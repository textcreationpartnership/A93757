         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF I were to Judge of all others by my ſelf, I ſhould think that all People of whatever Age or Condition of Life, ſhould earneſtly catch at and be very deſirous to look into and read all Books concerning Death and Mortality; if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might light upon any thing therein, which may either mitigate or leſſen that fear of Death, which even in the midſt of and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Life is ſenſible in all Mens minds. Which ſame fear <hi>hath Torment</hi> and doth afflict them. But more eſpecially if they may find any thing in their reading of this kind, which may Teach, Inſtruct and Direct them what they muſt do to be Happy after Death, and to make ſure of it, all one as it is deſired to live comfortably and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py before Death. for if People are ſo very much concerned (as we ſee they are) <hi>what they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all eat, and what they ſhall drink, and wherewithal they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:154355:3"/> be clothed</hi> for this ſhort time, becauſe theſe things are preſent and ſenſible, they ſhould alſo take care beforehand, nay, they muſt and will unavoidably think, when the <hi>end is come, the end is come,</hi> Ezek. 7. 6. (which is doubled becauſe the thing is <hi>eſtabliſhed by God</hi> and for the certainty thereof) whether it ſhall go well or ill with them throughout all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for then theſe things will be preſent and ſenſible alſo. And it being the higheſt Wiſdom to do thoſe things whilſt living (eſpecially ſince thoſe things are to be only done in our Life-time. <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me whilſt it is day, the night cometh when no Man can work)</hi> which we ſhall wiſh and deſire we had done when we come to die, this ſhould influence and actually perſuade People even in the midſt of their Youth, Health and Vigour, when they are Luſty and Strong, yea throughout all their Life here on Earth, to be continually employed about this one thing needful of <hi>ſetting their Soul in Order</hi> againſt the time it ſhall go out of this Body, and to make ſure that when their Earthly Houſe of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhall be diſſolved, they may have a Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God, not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>This is the difference between the Godly and Sinners, between Wiſe Men and Fools; the Godly and Wiſe do only thoſe things in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore it be too late, or the <hi>Door is ſhut,</hi> which the Sinners and Fools do at laſt bethink themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:154355:3"/> and wiſh (it is the part of Fools to ſay, I never thought it would come to this) when it is too late and the time is over and paſt.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt ſaid, the People of <hi>Nineveh</hi> will riſe up in Judgment againſt the People of this Generation and condemn them. So I teſtifie in this my day, that the Heathen may riſe up in Judgment againſt the People of this Generation and condemn them. For they (eſpecially the wiſer ſort, ſome of them defining Wiſdom to be a Meditation of Death) did ſearch and enquire diligently and think continually what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them after Death; albeit they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly concerning Immortality and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Life; but they had only a little glimmering and conjecture thereof. And yet this did put them upon the practice of Moral Virtue and the doing of Good Actions, that thereby they might be Happy after Death. But now in this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Countrey, there is a moſt clear Goſpel-Light and Revelation concerning it; yet to moſt People herein Death is like a Damp which puts out all their Lights of Pleaſure; and through Satan's act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all deceivableneſs in them that periſh, the greateſt part of Men and Women do concern themſelves but very little about it. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Supineneſs and Negligence (which is the miſcarriage of the whole Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld) the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the Heirs of Life and Immortality in all their ſeveral Generations and Countries
<pb facs="tcp:154355:4"/> were always and all along even in the midſt of Life, Health and Proſperity, great Meditators of Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h.</p>
            <p>O that I my ſelf might be of their number; but as ſome little Hope and Evidence thereof I did always as for my part even from my Tender Years think very much of Death and what would follow thereon. I now call to remembrance my Thought and ſearching of Heart which was in the days of old, when I was but a Stripling, I did then Commune with mine own Heart, and my Spirit made diligent ſearch, What will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ind then that my Spirit would live and abide elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as truly God hath ſhewn this unto me from within my ſelf ever ſince I was a Child, and had the leaſt Knowledge of Good and Evil, that there was another Life and a ſucceeding State which People ſhould enter upon and go into after they were gone off from this Earth. I was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for the greater part, and I am ſtill as verily perſuaded and aſcertained of it, as I am ſure of this Life which I now live, or that I now write down theſe words. And thereupon revolving and pondering many things in my mind, how that all here is but vain, little and paſſing away as a Shadow and doth not ſignifie much afterwards, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in would I be Happy and Safe as to that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Eternal State of things, into which my
<pb facs="tcp:154355:4"/> Soul muſt be launched forth out of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I have made it my buſineſs to read all Books and Sermons that I could light upon which treat of this matter. But eſpecially I have ſearched and enquired diligently into the Scriptures, in the which we think that we have Eternal Life. But we know aſſuredly that the way to Eternal Life is taught and ſhewed therein. And I deſire that what things I have in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages, brought forth out of that Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heavenl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For I do not write theſe things out mine own Head, nor yet from mine own Imagination and Invention, but only from the Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s which <hi>are given to make us wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> and what is rightly inferred from Truth, is Truth likewiſe. And although this Scripture way of writing is not ſo much liked of and received by the Wiſe and Diſputer of this World, or by thoſe who would be thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earned according to Mode and Faſhion; Yet all other Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whether they <hi>ſteal every Man his word from his Neighbour</hi> and borrow it from other Mens Writings; or if it be the meer Product of their own Wit and Knowledge, if it doth not ariſe from and is bottomed on this Pillar and
<pb facs="tcp:154355:5"/> Ground of Truth, it is all but as ſo much Chaff in compariſon to the Wheat. <hi>I have more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than all my Teachers, for thy Teſtimonies are my Meditation. I underſtand more than the Antients, becauſe I keep thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many People think that they have the leaſt need of Books of any thing in the World; but they muſt neceſſarily have Food and Raiment for the Body, or Phyſick againſt or in the time of Sickneſs. But if ſuch had Faith and Knowledge, they would apprehend, that, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God is, <hi>Buy the Truth and ſell it not; alſo Wiſdom and Inſtruction and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. It was equally and alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to buy ſuch Books which contain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> as to buy Food and Raiment for the Body, or the things which Miniſter unto ſenſual Pleaſure. For the <hi>Incorruptible Seed of the Word</hi> doth all one feed up the Soul unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and is as neceſſary for her unto this end, as Meat and Drink doth feed and nouriſh the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and preſerve it in Temporal Life. The Word and Truth of God being that <hi>Bread which cometh down from Heaven and giveth Life unto the World.</hi> So that it is the beſt way of laying out our Money for that which is <hi>Bread</hi> indeed. As ſo it will appear when People muſt give account for every Talent received, and how they uſed and expended the
<pb facs="tcp:154355:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſame. Hereby alſo may be juſtified the Wiſdom of our Nation in giving a ſettled and eſtabliſhed Maintenance to ſuch as Preach Sermons; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo herein the <hi>Labourer is worthy of his Hire,</hi> Luk. 10. 7. If they did divide the Word of Truth aright, giving to every Man his Portion. Tho' here again is need of a diſtinguiſhing Judgment which can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate between the Precious and the Vile, (But he that is Spiritual Judgeth all things.) To know and diſcern between what Books are really Good to the Uſe of Edifying and what are not; ſo as to receive the one, and reject the other. <hi>He that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faithfully; What is the Chaff to the Wheat? ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 28. As <hi>all Scripture is profitable,</hi> ſo all Divine Truth is profitable, and ſuch Books as contain moſt of this ſort, and affect the Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Inſtructing and Exhorting the Soul to the Things which belong to her Peace, and how to make her Calling and Election ſure, theſe are to be preferred before all others; and accordingly thoſe People do think ſo who are <hi>renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</hi> and take delight in the Things of God.</p>
            <p>I had rather be faithful to him that appointed, yea and employed me in the Miniſtration of his Word, as <hi>Moſes was faithful in all his Houſe.</hi> As we were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo we ſpeak not as pleaſing Men, the

               <bibl>Iſaiah 38. 1.</bibl>
               <q>In thoſe Days was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſick unto Death, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, the Son of <hi>Amos,</hi> came unto him, and ſaid unto him, Thus ſaith the Lord, Set thine Houſe in Order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>A Serious and thorough Conſideration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death and Immortality, was the principal Inducement which did firſt bring me acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Ways of God; for I have thought much thereon from my Tender Years. And now as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Day after Day, nearer in Time towards it, ſo I ought to have it yet much more in Remembrance, with continued Thought and Searching of Heart, how I may grapple with that <hi>laſt Enemy;</hi> how either to pluck out or blunt the Edge of the Sting of Death, that the Grave may not have the Victory over, me, that is, ſo far overcome me, as to conſign me over unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, I would not therefore by mine own good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154355:10"/> will Preach one Sermon, nor yet make one Prayer unto God, wherein I did not mention ſomewhat or other of this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt calleth it, that we <hi>may underſtand this, that we would conſider our latter end,</hi> Deut. 32. 29.</p>
            <p>For indeed this is the Will of God, and of Chriſt, concerning us dying Creatures, as alſo it doth teach and inſtruct us, what Mind and Temper we ſhould be in, now we are for a very little while Breathing as yet on this Earth. <hi>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lamps burning, and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord,</hi> (obſerve that) <hi>when he will return from the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto him immediately; bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find watching.</hi> And ſo we ſhould every one of us wait and watch for the coming of the Lord our God, and eſpecially for his Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

At the Death or Departure of each Perſon, the Body or Duſt returns to the Earth, as it was, and the Spirit to God that gave it.</p>

Nevertheleſs I will prove and make out what I afore-affirmed. Common Reaſon ſheweth that a growing Tree is equally alive in the midſt of Winter, although it doth ſeem as a barren, dead, and dry Tree, becauſe then it doth not run in Sap, nor ſhoot forth in green Leaves, even ſo by the very ſame ſimilitude, by ſuppoſing it contrariwiſe, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that in the midſt of Youth, Health, Life and Vigour (which are the Spring and Summer of our Age) we are all the while ſick unto Death; or as it is appoſitely and properly expreſſed in the Office of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, <hi>In the midſt of Life we are in Death,</hi> becauſe that we do all along carry about us in our Body the Seeds of this ſickneſs unto Death, or the Seeds of Mortality: According as it is expreſſed in the Book of <hi>Job, The Root of the matter is in you;</hi> ſo as ſoon as we are Born, the Root of ſickneſs, (which is the uſual forer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154355:11"/>
            <p>The Spirit of God did ſay thus of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> even when he had Fifteen Years longer to live, as appears by the ſequel of that Story; and ſo the ſame holds true of all Mankind ſeverally. Though perhaps ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them may have the ſame period of time twice, thrice or four times over; for perhaps ſome of them, eſpecially Children, may have thirty, forty five or ſixty Years to live longer; yet even at this very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are all ſick unto Death. A proportionable number of ſtrokes with an Hatchet will cut down the biggeſt Tree that did ever grow on the Earth: And although one ſtroke is given now, and then another, the Tree is all the while a cutting down. Even ſo each Day and Night, every Riſing and Setting of the Sun are two ſtrokes of this Hatchet, which (as Time is always in flux and ſucceſſion) continues to be ſtill cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Tree of our Life. To purſue this ſame ſimilitude again, though it be to another matter, yet it is to the ſame ſubject ſtill, as to our own Death and Mortality. As it is written, <hi>But every man in his own order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. ſo I have often thought, that as God is the Lord of Life, he taketh away one and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another in his own Order, which his own Order is not to us diſcernable; becauſe that no reſpect or difference is had to Age, (for the oldeſt doth not moſt commonly go firſt) the Good or Evil, the Godlineſs or Ungodlineſs of the Perſon, that one lives longer than another. But the caſe of us all dying Creatures, as we are under the Everliving and Almighty God, is juſt like ſo many Trees growing in a Wood or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee: As to which the Owner or Proprietor ſends his Bayliff, or Orders his Workmen to cut down one, and then another, according as each is marked out, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath uſe and occaſion either for a tender Plant, or a well-grown Timber Tree for Building, or an old Tree for the Fire; even ſo the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thereof; which again is but a Reprieve, and ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite; for at laſt comes the Sickneſs or Accident, which is indeed unto Death. The Lord God of Heaven, (who knows all things) knows which of the Trees growing in this or that part of his Wood, (as are the ſeveral Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Towns and Villages throughout the Earth) are marked out for the very next to be cut down.

            <p>The Word of Inſtruction, which doth ariſe from this Conſideration and Apprehenſion is this, As when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Verily one of you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me. And they were exceeding ſorrowful, and began e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them to ſay, Lord, Is it I? Mat.</hi> 26. 21, 22. ſo we may even now hear the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God our Creator, ſpeaking unto us from Heaven on this wiſe, Verily I ſay unto you, that all of ye ſhall die. but one of you in particular ſhall die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt. God now ſpeaketh thus from Heaven unto every Neighbourhood and Aſſembly of People;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154355:12"/> and we ſhould be hereupon not ſo much exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, as exceeding careful; to live in <hi>trembling, Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. and <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear.</hi> For we ſhould every one of us begin to fear and provide in ſuch a manner, as if it was certainly I my ſelf that muſt die the very firſt, and next of any one in this Pariſh or Neighbourhood. It is godly diſcretion ſo to live each and every Day, as if it ſhould be certainly our laſt; and ſo it is here the ſame godly Diſcretion, and Soul-ſaving Wiſdom, to reckon upon our ſelves as the Man that ſhall die the very next; for it is an eſſential part of Wiſdom to think the worſt, and put the caſe at the worſt, and to provide beforehand againſt the worſt that ſhall or can poſſibly happen) for in both theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we are never the nearer Death for thus doing, but only better provided and prepared for it. We ſhould ſo live now we are <hi>ſick unto Death,</hi> in the ſence afore-explained, as if we were indeed <hi>ſick unto Death</hi> in the common meaning and acceptation of the Word. We ſhould ſo live every Day now we carry the Seeds of Corruption and Mortality about with us, as we would live if the Plague were upon us, and the Blue Spots and Tokens did appear on our Skin, which do always and certainly preſage a very near approaching Death: The Reaſon whereof is this, Becauſe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day muſt come into account, and we muſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Thoughts, Words a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is no great need of another immediate Revelation from Heaven for this; for God hath already taught it unto us, by that common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he hath given unto us as his reaſonable Creatures: But yet God willing more abundantly to acqnaint us with a leſſon of ſo very great Importance,

For it hath a much more Noble, even a Spiritual Sence and Signification, to ſet our Souls, which dwell in this Earthly Houſe of the Body, in order, for we ſhall dye, or yet more properly, we ſhall leave theſe Habitations of Clay. Therefore I ſay, that God hath ordered the ſame, for further ſecurity; and to bring it yet more to our Knowledge and Remembrance, to be written in his Statute Book the Bible, as alſo we may find the ſame Engraven in the Word, that is nigh us, even in our Heart; for we may alſo perceive a ſtill Voice ſpeaking from thence, <hi>Set thine Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye, and not live.</hi>

Why, In the Prophets mentioned in the foregoing Verſe: Whoſe Spirit did actuate them all, juſt like as the Soul doth actuate the Body. Although Chriſt was than in Heaven, and they were here on Earth, in their ſeveral Generations, long
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154355:15"/> before God did ſend his Son in the fulneſs of Time, for to become Fleſh. The Spirit of God and of Chriſt are near one, and the ſame; and ſo God and the Word of God are one, and the ſame; according to that common Maxim, Nothing is in God, but what is God himſelf. So that we are not to look upon thoſe words which we find written in the Bible, as the words of <hi>Moſes, Samuel, Job, David,</hi> and the Prophets; or thoſe in the New Teſtament, as the words of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who yet did write and ſpeak them; but we ſhould conſider of it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and further as the word of God and Chriſt, which God and Chriſt ſpake by them. As when we ſend a Letter to one at a Hundred Miles diſtance, whom we have known or heard of; we do by that ſame Letter, ſpeak to him in effect; yea, and as much to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, as if we were in the ſame Room together, and we did talk to them face to face: So I have often thought, that the Scriptures are as the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Epiſtle of the Moſt High God; which is ſent unto us, the Inhabitants of this Earth; for hereby God doth ſpeak unto us from Heaven, the Habitation of his Holineſs, which is more than a Thouſand or a Million of Miles diſtance from us, all one as if we heard out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly his Voice (which in that ſence, no Man hath ſeen God at any time, nor heard his Voice) or as if the Lord did dwell Viſibly amongſt us, which he doth not.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo? Yes verily, Then this is a mighty Argument, and terrible Conſideration againſt thoſe who refuſe to Read, or Hear the Word of God, <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> Heb. 12. 25. It was the Angel on Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets that ſpake on the Earth; but it is Chriſt the Son of God that now ſpeaketh from Heaven. For though Jeſus Chriſt is long ſince aſcended on High, and Sits on the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154355:15"/> Right Hand of the Father; yet he ſpeaketh to us from Heaven, even now in his Word, and in the Preaching and Miniſtry thereof. For as Moſes <hi>of old time hath in every City, them that Preach him, being Read in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> every <hi>Sabbath Day:</hi> Even ſo now, Chriſt hath thoſe who continually Preach him as <hi>Moſes</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And who will not hear the Miniſters of Chriſt, who preach him, or who Preach the Word of God; for whoſoever Preacheth the Word of God, Preacheth Chriſt, in as much as Chriſt is the Word of God: Neither would ſuch be perſwaded, if Chriſt ſhould come once again into the World, after the ſame manner as he did, which will not be ſo; for his next coming will be unto Judgment; which <hi>Will be in Glory and in Power, and in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But in the mean while, he hath gave the Word, and there are thoſe who Preach it. He hath ſent forth Labourers into his Harveſt, with full Power and Commiſſion, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> Luke 10. 16. Even the Great God himſelf, who made the World and all things therein. What do ye think will become of thoſe who deſpiſe God? As they who deſpiſe his Word, either preached or ſpoken, written or printed, do deſpiſe God himſelf. Why? God hath fortold us, what will become of ſuch, <hi>They that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30.

And ſo it is found true in them what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, who herein ſpake much more like a Chriſtian than like an Heathen (for Fleſh and Blood could not reveal theſe things unto him, but God his Creator) ſaith he, <hi>That day which ſome fear to be their laſt</hi> (he means the Day of Death) <hi>is indeed the Birth-day of Immortali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This one thing to remember and practice, to obſerve and do is Benefit and Uſe enough for your coming to hear this Sermon. But I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible beforehand of all the Exhortation that hath or can be uſed as to this matter that this will be the effect of hearing this and of all other Sermons. As it was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, <hi>And ſome believed the things which were ſpoken, and ſome believed not,</hi> Acts 28. 24. So ſome of ye will obey and do according to the things that have been ſpoken, others again will not obey and do thereafter. Some of ye will hear and endeavour to remember by pondering theſe things in your Heart after ye are gone from hence (as <hi>Mary</hi> laid up the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus in her Heart) there be thoſe again who will hear with one Ear, and let it out with another, that it ſhall go off and be with them as a flaſh, and a noiſe, and as the Wind that paſſeth away.</p>

            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:154355:21"/>
            <p>But this Phraſe of the Holy Ghoſt hath a further meaning than all this, even a Spiritual Sence and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, therefore I now proceed to explain and handle it in that Threefold ſence and meaning, which the words will naturally bear without any forced or violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction made upon them.</p>
            <p>As Man is uſually conſidered in a Threefold Capacity, outward Eſtate, Body and Soul; of which two laſt he is made up and conſtituted, but the firſt is a thing appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant extrinſical and belonging to him: So to ſet his Houſe in order doth denote theſe three things.</p>
            <p>1ſt, To ſet his outward Eſtate in order.</p>
            <p>2dly, To ſet his Body in order.</p>
            <p>3dly, To ſet his Soul in order, for this is the moſt Principal thing. That all theſe are ſeverally meant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and intended when the Holy Ghoſt ſpake thus by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> unto <hi>Hezekiah, Set thine Houſe in order,</hi> will appear from other places of Scripture, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Inſpiration from God, as alſo from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon of things.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved, that it is a Man's Prudence to make his laſt Will and Teſtament in the midſt of Life and Health, and to keep it always ready by him, For the Party is never the nearer Death for ſo doing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ready and prepared for it. For in ſickneſs there is Pain and Weakneſs enough to grapple withal which will employ the Mind and Sence; ſo that it is beſt to be troubled or perplexed as little as poſſible about Worldly and outward things, ſo from that manner of Speech of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> No <hi>Man that Warreth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 4. It is not ſaid, he doth meddle at all but not Entangle, that is, not involve or Plunge himſelf in; for this is a mighty hindrance to the Things of God. So his real Servant, who is Faithful and Spiritual, as he doth not that throughout his Life; ſo from hence I have often
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154355:22"/> thought, that it is not only Godly Diſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving Wiſdom, but indeed it is a happy and bleſſed condition, ſo to have ordered and ſettled all Worldly things before, that <hi>when we come to Die indeed, then we may have nothing to do but to Die.</hi> As Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould not then be for us to get juſt as we come to Die, but they ſhould be gotten and had long before. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo in like manner as to the diſpoſition of this Worlds Goods, it will be expedient not to be diſtracted then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that buſineſs, but care alſo as to them ſhould have been taken ſome conſiderable time before. For when one lies upon the Bed of ſickneſs, or in the Extremity and point of Death there are other important things both of Body and Soul for to Mind and be buſied about then.</p>
            <p>2dly, The Second Branch of that Duty enjoyned, ſet thine Houſe in order, is to ſet our Body in order. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. the Body in expreſs words is called an <hi>Earthly Houſe.</hi> For we <hi>know that if our Earthly Houſe of</hi> this Tabernacle <hi>be diſſolved, we have a Building of God, an Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe not Built with Hands, Eternal in Heaven.</hi> So this allows and juſtifies for our taking and interpreting the words of our Text in this ſence alſo. <hi>Set thine Houſe in order,</hi> that is, ſet the Earthly Houſe of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body in order.</p>
            <p>Now indeed there cannot be much ſaid as to this, inaſmuch as the Body is but as the husk or ſhell, and as a tenement of Clay. And how can it then be ſet in order juſt as it is going to diſſolve and moulder into the Duſt? But when the Holy Ghoſt doth in ſo particular a manner record, <hi>And when</hi> Jacob <hi>had made an end of Commanding his Sons, he gathered up his Feet into the Bed and yielded up the Ghoſt,</hi> Gen. 49. 33. <hi>By Faith</hi> Joſeph <hi>when he died gave Comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154355:22"/> we learn that the Body is not only to be ſet in order throughout the cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of its Life, by endeavouring to keep it in a ſtate of Health, Sobriety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Purity and Charity! But even after its diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution care is to be taken and order to be given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand concerning a decent Interment and Burial thereof. As theſe Bodies of ours are the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God; for indeed to thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and conſider them throughly, they do appear to be a Noble, Excellent and Admirable Structure. <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> But then eſpecially as theſe Bodies of ours have a further Pre-e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inence and Honour as to be the <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you.</hi> And therefore Proportionably reſpect and concern is to be had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that theſe <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> and this <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> may be ſet in order before and after that we die.</p>
            <p>When the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> takes particular notice, <hi>By Faith</hi> Joſeph <hi>when he died, gave Commandment concerning his Bones,</hi> hereby he would ſhew forth unto us <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s belief at that very time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a future State and of the Reſurrection. How that he had then a Faith and expectation, that thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feet which his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> had gathered up into the Bed, as alſo his own Bones of his Body though now they were to become Duſt and to be Buried, yet as he ſaith in the Original place, <hi>God will ſurely Viſit you</hi> (he means his Kinſmen, the Stock and Children of <hi>Iſrael) and ye ſhall carry up my Bones from hence,</hi> Gen 50. 25. As much as if he ſhould have ſaid, God will ſurely Viſit us all, both my Kinſmen, Brethren, my ſelf and all that ſhall deſcend from us (which afterwards were like the Stars in the Heaven, or the Sand on the Sea-ſhore for Multitude) and ſo all the Generations and Perſons of Mankind, when <hi>He that turneth Man to Destruction, ſhall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154355:23"/> ſay, Return ye Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 90. 5. This is <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting</hi> and doing ſomewhat more for them; and then thoſe very ſame Bones of mine which I now take an Oath from ye that ye ſhall carry them up from hence, God <hi>will lay Sinews upon them, and bring Fleſh upon them, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d cover them with Skin and put Breath in them, and ye ſhall live and know that I am the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 37. 6. Which will be Literally fulfilled at the laſt Day. When this ſame Body and theſe ſame Bones, which is now ſeen to be lain and Buried in the Ground and turns to Corruption, and diſſolution ſhall be raiſed up and be made whole and intire again in like manner (though it will be done more ſuddenly, for it ſhall be done in <hi>a moment, in a twinkling of an Eye, for the Trumpet ſhall Sound, and the Dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible and we ſhall be changed)</hi> as they were corrupted and diſſolved. The Scripture all along and throughout is ſo very full and clear as to the Reſurrection of the Body in a Literal ſence, that it is to be admired how any that Name the Name of Chriſt or call themſelves Chriſtians, can deny or disbelieve it. Though I have heard and talked with ſome now-a-days, who juſt like <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let as</hi> have Erred as concerning the Reſurrection, ſaying that it is already paſt. For the only Reſurrection, as ſome Erroneous People would have it, is a riſing again to Newneſs of Life and in a Spiritual ſence. True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is a riſing to Newneſs of Life here that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y riſe to the Reſurrection of Life hereafter. And Bleſſed are they which have their part in this firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, upon them the ſecond Death hath no Power. But beſides this, the Scriptures do in divers places ſpeak expreſly and clearly of the Reſurrection of the Body; and what God hath joyned together let no Man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. So that they muſt be infidels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d deny the Faith, who ſhall gainſay or disbelieve it.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:154355:23"/>
            <p>As Jeſus Chriſt proved the Reſurrection of the Dead from that general expreſſion in the Old Teſtament, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob; then comes the Reaſoning and Inference, <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> And ſo if any one ſhould go about to prove the Reſurrection of the Body from this ſaying of <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon his Death Bed, <hi>God ſhall ſurely Viſit you;</hi> it might at firſt ſeem an hard matter to make it out from thence. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will eaſily and clearly appear, if we attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and conſider throughly that Reaſoning and Inference, which lies as it were hidden within thoſe very words. For though indeed and in truth theſe words according to the intent and meaning of <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he then ſpake them, were a prophecy and foretelling that God would bring the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> the Houſe of Bondage unto that good Land, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he had promiſed and Sworn unto <hi>Abram</hi> that begat them, that he would do. But as the Apoſtle ſaith by the Spirit concerning what befel the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph, All thoſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them in a Figure:</hi> So what God did and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things Recorded of them, they are a Shew and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to us, they are a Type and Signification, that as the Lord God the Creator and Preſerver, yea, and the Reſtorer of Mankind, did lead forth the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilderneſs into the Land of Promiſe: So he did before that time and hath ever ſince, and doth continue to do ſo at this Day to lead all the Generations, yea and ſingle Perſons of Men and Women of every Nation, Countrey and Language from and throughout this Earth unto the Land of Promiſe the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> either to the New Heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where every Son and Daughter of Men, and all the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſhall be, after that we ſhall Die and are removed from hence.</p>
            <p>But now I come to that inward Reaſoning and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which lies couched and included within thoſe words of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and (Reader) do thou obſerve it. When we Die it is evidently ſeen that the Soul and Breath vaniſheth and goes away and ſeems to be nothing at all. And ſo the Body or Houſe of Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y putrifies and turns into common Earth and undiſtinguiſhable Duſt, and conſequently as good as nothing, or as nothing as to a Reaſonable and Living Creature. Now what is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nothing, cannot be properly the Object of God's care and concern; and what is not ſimply nothing, or as it were nothing, he doth not neither ſo much mind. Becauſe that as God is a Being, or rather the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Root, Centre and Comprehenſive of all Beings, he containing all things that are in himſelf. As the Divinely Inſpired <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>His tender Mercy is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his Works.</hi> So of neceſſity it muſt be his work or being for to engage God's Conſervation, care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about it. As we learn from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26. Every leaſt Word or Particle of Scripture is obſervable; for from out of it may be gathered ſome Truth and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: So that when we Read <hi>Therefore Sprang there even of one, and him as good as Dead,</hi> Heb. 11, 12. From hence we may Reaſon and infer, that when any one is Dead, he is then as we commonly ſay, as good as nothing. And inaſmuch as <hi>God is not the God of the Dead but of the Living,</hi> therefore when <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſpake thus by the Spirit, <hi>God ſhall ſurely Viſit you</hi> (both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf included when he was juſt giving up the Ghoſt, as alſo his Brethren who were to Die a little afterwards, hereby muſt be meant and underſtood (as the laſt End

               </gap>; for when our friends and acquaintance are once Dead, if we are perhaps invited and go to their Funeral and accompany their Corps to the Ground, there is an end of all Viſits as to them.

And alſo when we Read of a Duty implied, of <hi>Viſiting and Miniſtring unto thoſe that are Sick or in Priſon,</hi> Mat. 25. 43, 44.

What do all their good and pitiful words ſignify which coſt them nothing? People are very free of them, and of their fruitleſs Wiſhes, when they Viſit People in Impriſonment or in Diſtreſs: Or they ſpend their Time in ſome vain, worldly Talk, without dropping one Word of Godly and Divine Converſation. But as God is infinitely greater and better than Man, ſo his Viſits do as much differ from, and proportionably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154355:25"/> theirs in Help and Benefit. For whereas Man ſays and doth not (which is ſometimes for want of Power, and more commonly through Diſſimulation, or for want of Will) God both ſays and doth. Our Good and Gracious God doth moſt effectually anſwer the true end of all Viſits. For he never makes a Viſit, where it is underſtood in a way of Love and Friendſhip (for the Scripture alſo makes mention of God's Viſiting in a way of Anger and Puniſhment, as <hi>Jer. 5. 9. Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? Shall not my Soul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?)</hi> But either he doth ſome good thing, or ſome helpful thing to thoſe he viſits. With God to ſay and to do, is one and the ſame thing. For he ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt. For hath he ſaid, and ſhall it not come to paſs?

The Apoſtle goes on to add in verſ. 22. <hi>But now being made free from ſin, and become the Servants of God, ye have your fruit unto Holineſs, and your end everlaſting life.</hi> From hence we learn, that to ſet theſe Bodies of ours in order, is to keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from ſin; for hereby we ſhall with them ſerve God. And what is the bleſſed conſequent of all? <hi>Ye have your fruit unto Holineſs, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154355:27"/> That this doing, and thus ſetting them in order, is the way for God to ſet them in order in the Reſurrection, in the day of Judgment, and the future Eternal State which ſucceeds after that. <hi>An Holy Body, is an Orderly Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, this proves and confirms, that as we do carry along with us, in theſe our Bodies, the Seeds of Mortality and Corruption: So if we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or can get Holineſs ingraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To mention again the Apoſtle's Dehortation, That <hi>ye yield not your Members Servants to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and to Iniquity unto Iniquity;</hi> and as we naturally receive in Food, and put on Raiment to avoid Hunger and Cold; and as we would not willingly throw our ſelves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So by the very ſame conſequence, we ſhould abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil; but more eſpecially and particularly, we ſhould abſtain from thoſe Sins and Evils which ſooner bring on Diſeaſes and Death, than others.

So Adultery, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and following the ſtrange Woman, renders Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple weakly and ſhort liv'd, and <hi>brings rottenneſs into their Bones,</hi> that their Body and their Fleſh are conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as ſome of us have ſeen ſad Spectacles, Examples, and Monuments thereof. So Anger, Wrath, Malice, Hatred, Variance, Envyings, ſet People together by the Ears, to Wound or Murder one another, when they go forth by Armies or ſingle Perſons. Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Idleneſs doth tempt them to Steal and Rob upon the High-way; which at length brings them to the Gallows. So indeed almoſt every Sin, one way or another, is a <hi>Deſtroyer;</hi> for it haſtens ſooner into the Pit of Deſtruction. And it is one of thoſe <hi>Paths of the Deſtroyer</hi> mentioned in <hi>Pſal</hi> 17. 4. even of Satan, the inviſible Enemy of Mankind, who hath his Name in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and in the Greek, <hi>Apollyon.</hi> Both which in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, ſignifies a <hi>Deſtroyer.</hi> Which he makes uſe of, to lead the Sons and Daughters of Men into the Chambers of Death; the very Pit and Brink of Hell, till at laſt they drop into it.</p>
            <p>This place of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. 4. is ſo excellent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, and there is ſo much neceſſary and uſeful Truth contained in it; that it is worthy to be quoted out at length, for the Reader to meditate upon the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy and the Word of Inſtruction which ariſes from thence: <hi>Concerning the Works of men, by the Word of thy Lips have I kept me from the Paths of the Deſtroyer.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:154355:28"/> As much as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſay, let other Men do as they will, if they go on to deſtroy themſelves, as we ſee the Works of Men are, and by their manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad in the World they do; as for my part, I will make God's Word my Guide and my Rule; I will be ſure to keep to that and not vary from it, and then I ſhall keep my ſelf from the <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hs of the Deſtroyer.</hi> I ſhall not be in thoſe Paths which the Blood-thirſty and deceitful Men are in, who do not live out half their Days; and which thoſe Sinners and Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity are in, who do not live out half their days; for if it had not been for that, they might have attained unto the Days of their Fathers. But this Rule doth not hold always, for ſometimes the Wicked grow old and are mighty in Power; as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith. And then chiefly my Comfort is, as long as I hold my ſelf to the Word of Gods Lips, not to turn aſide from it, to the Right Hand or to the Left, thereby I keep my ſelf from the Paths that lead to Hell, the Place of Deſtruction, which is on the other ſide of the Grave.</p>
            <p>And ſo to preſerve our Bodies from falling into that Place of Deſtruction, is to keep and ſet them in order; for to that end we ſhould have them <hi>ordered according to the Word of Gods Lips.</hi> And this is according to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. to have them made free from Sin. <hi>Let not Sin therefore reign in your mortal Body,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren by the Merci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154355:29"/> for the Soul to Act in. It is evidently ſeen, that the Body upon the Deceaſe or Departure of the Soul from out of it, is juſt like an empty Houſe, Tenement or Cottage without any Inhabitant at all in it; which as that thereupon doth fall into Ruin and Decay, without any one to mind or look after it; ſo the Body yet much ſooner Moulders into Corruption, Stink and Duſt. <hi>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare are upon thee, O In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 24. 17. This is a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and appoſite Expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, to call us Inhabitants of the Earth. From whence I will go on to Remark yet further, that juſt like as Snails car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Houſes upon their Backs, even ſo we carry about the Houſes of our Habitation (I mean this little Tenement of Clay, the Body) all along, and every where with us. We are wrapt up and covered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with it. And it is a moveable walking <hi>Houſe, that hath not Foundations,</hi> Heb. 11. 9. which herein is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto and diſtinct from that City, <hi>which hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> there mentioned in the next following Verſe. And alſo herein it is oppoſite unto and diſtinct from that <hi>Houſe Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>Now what we muſt do, or how to behave our ſelves, to ſet our ſelves (who inhabit and are contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this earthly Houſe) in Order, proceed we to ſhew according to that meaſure of Knowledge which our Creator hath given unto us. To <hi>ſet in Order,</hi> in one Sence is a kind of Speech which is uſed, when from out of a great mixed and confuſed Multitude of Men; theſe are Marſhalled and put in order of an Army: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is obſerved of a well Diſciplined Army; that it is one of the moſt orderly things in the World, when each Officer and Souldier (notwithſtanding their vaſt Multitude) knows and ſtands in his proper Place, Rank and File, not moving one Hands breadth from out of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154355:30"/> it to the Right Hand or to the Left; and they do move and act nothing without Command or Order. And ſo when we read in <hi>Joel 2. 7, 8. And they ſhall March every one on his ways, and they ſhall not break their Ranks, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall one thruſt another, they ſhall walk every one in his Path:</hi> Obſerve all this, for theſe things being ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dictated by his Spirit, hereby we are ſhewn and inſtructed, how God is infinitely pleaſed and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this thing of <hi>Order</hi> in his <hi>Army,</hi> and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>great Camp</hi> (for ſo it is there called, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is) of his Creatures or Created Beings.</p>

            <p>But now to return again into the way of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe. As a King or a General doth go forth to view their reſpective Armies; and they order their Men to be drawn forth, and to ſtand in Battel Array, that out of them they might Detach and Pick out ſome Choſen Men for ſuch a particular Action, or Enterprize they ſend them about. Even ſo, <hi>The Lord looketh from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he beholdeth all the Sons of Men; from the place of his Habitation, he looketh upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi> And now he calls out one to Death, and then again he calls another, and then a third, and ſo on. <hi>The Stars in their Courſes, fought againſt</hi> Siſera. And as they above are ſeen and obſerved to be in their <hi>Courſes,</hi> ſo it is expected and commanded by the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that all the Inhabitants of the Earth ſhould ſtand and be in their Order. For as the Soldiers in an Army know not what particular Man the General will Detach and take out next. Even ſo we the Inhabitants
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154355:31"/> of the Earth, know not which of us the Lord our God will call out next by his Trumpeter or Meſſenger, Death: But this we certainly know, that we ſhall be called out every one of us, one time or another. When the General or Captain calls for a Man, and he is not to be found in his Order and Place, woe be to that Man; for he thereupon undergoes ſome Reproof, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or he is ſhot to death. And ſo in like manner, if our Souls are not ſet in Order before, and when God calls and requires them out from our Bodies, woe be unto thoſe Souls, for the Reproof, Threatning and Puniſhment of God will befal them. Thus much is ſignified and to be underſtood from what is written, <hi>And when the King came in to ſee the Gueſts, he ſaw there a Man which had not on a Wedding-Garment. And he ſaith unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having on a Wedding-Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs. Then ſaid the King to the Servants, bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> From all this Parable, or rather Similitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed, whereby our condition here in this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body, in reference to the ever-living God over all, is truly ſet forth and ſhewn unto us; we learn, that to ſet our Souls in Order, is to get them in a readineſs, or in a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate of watching, or waiting an expectation againſt our Lord's coming and calling us, not knowing when it will be; and that we be ſure to keep in our proper Place and Station, in our Courſe and Order he hath ſet us; to be a doing and finiſhing his Work which he hath employed us about: <hi>That as the Son of Man left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man his Work, and Commanded the Porter to watch,</hi> Mark 13. 34. ſo we may have the Bleſſing promiſed and pronounced, that when he cometh, he may find us ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Another ſence and ſignification of ſetting in Order, is taken from what <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Titus,</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154355:32"/> cauſe left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that were wanting,</hi> In the Margent there it is left undone. From hence it will appear, inaſmuch as this Scripture was given forth by the ſame Spirit, that the meaning of the Spirit when he Commanded to ſet our Houſes in Order, or as hath been interpreted, the Soul, the Inhabitant of this Houſe in Order, is to ſet in Order the things that are wanting, or what are left undone. That is, I ſuppoſe, and gather, to fill up and ſupply what is wanting, and to do what is yet left undone. I do believe that this is the principal meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in the Text. For that of ſetting the Soul in a readineſs, is included in this. For if there is nothing wanting in the Soul, then it is in its proper Order, Station or Place. If there be nothing left undone, then certainly ſhe is upon doing and finiſhing the Work, which the Lord God of Heaven hath given and committed unto her for to do.</p>
            <p>And now, ſet your Thoughts, O Man, to work and upon the ſearch. As <hi>Paul</hi> did for this Cauſe leave <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> that he ſhould ſet in Order the things that are wanting; even ſo the everlaſting God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ends of the Earth, for this Cauſe leaves us a little longer here on the Earth, that we ſhould ſet in Order the things that are wanting. Conſider then throughly, and bethink your ſelves well, what things are now wanting to your Salvation, there be ſure to ſupply and fill them up before you die: and what things are left undone, there be ſure to do and perform the ſame. And ſtill if ye can apprehend any thing more, there alſo go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>I am greatly afraid that <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> is not the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which was againſt <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> of old time; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it lies againſt every one of us at this day.

Their Actions are not ſo good as they might have been. <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. <hi>For the Lord is a God of Knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 3. And ſo he knows where, and in what point ſuch and ſuch Actions are wanting. Though we his Miniſters and Creatures, by reaſon of our half imperfect and outward Knowledge, cannot preſently aſſign it. The Actions of all the Children of Men will be found wanting in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Sight and Judgment of the Lord; yet they ſhould not be found wanting in our own Knowledge, Sight and Endeavour. But we ſhould ſtill preſs and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to come up to that State whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh as to himſelf; I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not hereby juſtified. That is, he knew no ſin or fault which he allowed himſelf in, and no Duty which he left undone. And ſuch a State may any Chriſtian now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a days (by that common Grace which God uſually gives) arrive unto, if he will. Though <hi>Paul</hi> was thus Innocent, Upright and Obedient, yet he going on to add that hereby he was not juſtified; that is, before God. This confirms the truth of what was aforeſaid;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154355:33"/> that though we do to the very beſt that ever we can, endeavouring and labouring to the very utmoſt that our Actions be not found wanting, until they ſeem to us as if they were not wanting, yet ſtill in the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they will be found wanting. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof is, <hi>For the Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth, for Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.</hi> So the Lord knoweth not as Man knoweth, for Man knoweth the outward appearance, only by halves and imperfectly: But the Lord knoweth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and throughout, even all that is to be known in any thing. For the Lord is a God of Knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed. Nevertheleſs, the Lord doth require of, and command us to do our very beſt, though when we have done all that is commanded us, we are but unprofitable Servants; and we are to uſe our utmoſt, and continued diligence, that we be not found wanting; though after all, and at the laſt, we ſhall be found wanting. This ſeems to be the turning and deciding point; why ſome will be ſaved, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will be condemned at the laſt day. The Souls of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, did, whilſt they were here in the Body, and in the days of the Fleſh, labour and endeavour with all their ſtrength, and with all their might, (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved <hi>Laban</hi> with all his might) that they ſhould not be found wanting. That nothing ſhould be wanting in them, towards obtaining their own Salvation. They did <hi>run, ſtrive,</hi> and <hi>fight</hi> (as the Scripture Phraſes are) in doing whatever they could, if by any means they might obtain unto the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead. And ſo God (who doth not lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man more than is right) doth accept of this their good mind, and good will towards him. He will not expect from a Creature more than he is able; ſo ſuch are received by him, they are admitted, and do enter into their Maſter's Joy.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:154355:33"/>
            <p>But contrariwiſe, the Souls of them that ſhall be condemned, poſſibly they might ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; that is, uſe a little careleſs, idle, and cuſtomary endeavour, but they did not <hi>ſtrive,</hi> Luke 13. 24. for then they would have entred in. Neither did they uſe their continued labour and utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that they ſhould not be found wanting. It was a thing which they did a little, but not much mind; for now it is evidently ſeen and known in the World, that though all do pretend to ſerve God, and they ſay, that they hope to go to Heaven; yet ſome do more towards it than others. Whereas the Kingdom of Heaven will never be obtained by a parcel of lazy and outward cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Worſhippers. For from the days of <hi>John</hi> until this time, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent take it by force. Heaven and Immortality are for thoſe who <hi>ſtrive,</hi> who are <hi>ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, the labour of ſuch is not vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58. who <hi>ſeek diligently,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. who make it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant buſineſs throughout their life. As in <hi>Acts 28. 24. Some believed the things that were ſpoken, and ſome belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not.</hi> Some obey the Word, and ſome do not.

And alſo the reaſon of not only hating, but even ſtripping off the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh, to ſet the Soul in Order before ſhe goes out of the Body, will eaſily appear.</p>
            <p>By the way it is not proper nor yet a true expreſſion to ſay that the <hi>Soul doth die</hi> when it goes out of the Body; for indeed it doth not die but depart. But this is certain and evident that when ſhe goes out from the Body, ſhe is then ſtripped off from that Garment of Fleſh in the general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, the Body. For the Soul goes upwards and gets out from, and lays aſide the Body, which then ſeems as the Mantle that fell from <hi>Elijah</hi> at his going up to Heaven, and then ſhe becomes all and <hi>pure Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as aforeſaid, the Fleſh in it ſelf ſimply, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly is not Sinful nor Evil. For it was not ſo in its Original and firſt Creation. But after that <hi>Adam</hi> fell into the tranſgreſſion, all his Children and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants from his Loyns are conceived in Sin and brought forth in Iniquity. <hi>And they are polluted in their own Blood,</hi> Ezek. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 6. as ſoon as they are brought forth from their Mothers Womb. So that this Fleſh of ours is become a Seed plot of all manner of Sin and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Like Leaven, doth leaven the whole lump, ſo it hath ſpread and diffuſed it ſelf throughout the whole Fleſh and every part thereof. <hi>From the ſole of the foot even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it but wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores.</hi> Indeed Man was at firſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154355:38"/> the work of God's own <hi>hands, and truly a noble Creature Yet had I planted thee a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed, how then art thou turned into the degenerate Plant of a ſtrange Vine unto me?</hi> Jer. 2. 21. But ſince that, by his Fall he is turned topſie-turvy over what he was then. For now he is become Univerſally corrupt throughout. <hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> So that until he is renewed again after the Image of him who Created him, which is in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true Holineſs, he ſtands not only diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from, but as it were in perfect contrariety unto God. Said our Saviour to one of his Diſciples, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of Men.</hi> As if the things which did only ſavour of Men, were a ſtink and <hi>evil ſmell</hi> and a <hi>ſmoke in his Noſe,</hi> Iſa. 65. 5. which he could not endure, and would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and far from him. And ſo it is all one of the things which ſavour of the World and the things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat ſavour of the Fleſh; the infinite Holineſs and Uprightneſs of God is in no wiſe reconcileable unto them, nor yet doth approve of them. For they are all bad and nought, they being either the receptacle of Sin and Evil, or at leaſt they have a ſmell, taſte and tincture thereof, which the Holy and Pure God doth not like. In this ſence it is (not as ſome of the ignorant and fooliſh Popes did from thence forbid Prieſts to Marry) <hi>That they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8. 8. for the Fleſh as it is now, is either Sinful or Evil it ſelf, or it hath a ſavour of Sin and Evil. And it is the Will of God that we ſhould come out even from that.</p>
            <p>By what hath been aforeſaid, it may be underſtood what it is to hate and ſtrip off from us the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh, that is, ſpotted by the Sin or Evil which doth uſually lodge and dwell in the Fleſh. And care ſhould be all one taken as to this, as we would not

As we naturally fear and avoid all theſe, ſo if we were Spiritually minded, we would take as much heed of the World and of the Fleſh, although we are in the midſt of the one, and wrapped up and encompaſſed about with the other.

So again, as long as we are in the Body, we are in one ſence in the Fleſh; and accordingly the Scripture calls the time of this life the days of our Fleſh. But as long as we do not obey, yield, nor give way unto the motions of ſins that are in the Fleſh; If we keep under and cruſh even Concupiſcence which is the beginning of Luſt, and ſo the beginning of each ſin, or the tendency to each ſin; if we make not Proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfil th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The World and the Fleſh for the moſt part in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſence are taken for the Evil thereof, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons afore aſſigned. Becauſe Sin and Evil hath its Root, Being and Dwelling in them, and they are the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154355:39"/> occaſion thereof God hath therefore ſuffered, yea and placed us in the midſt of them, both for our greater Proof and Tryal, to prove us to know what is in our heart, whether we will keep his Commandments or no. By our being in the World and the Fleſh, and yet to be kept innocent and free from the Evil thereof, is juſt like treading upon Coals and not be burnt; which requires much and conſtant ſpeed, skill and care. Now for a ſeaſon (God having thought fit that it ſhould be ſo) we are encompaſſed about with and very near to manifold Temptations ariſing from the World and the Fleſh and the things thereof. That the Tryal of our Faith, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Holineſs and Innocency might be had.

            <p>The Word of God is very Spiritual and Heavenly; for it doth teach us (as we may find by the Inſtructions ſcattered up and down therein) that when a great deal of our life is ſpent and the day of Immortality is at hand, and we begin to move off from the Stage of this Earth, like as when Soldiers have a mind to draw off from beſieging a City of their own accord, thinking that either they cannot obtain or it is not worth their while to obtain it, then they draw off their Carriages, Burdens and Inſtruments of War before they march off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So it is where they do it with adviſedneſs, and deliberation, and they have ſufficient ſtrength. Even ſo, many of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hings of this World and of the Fleſh we cannot obtain which we would; and if we could, we cannot hold or continue to have them; for we die and go away. Or if we could, yet they are not worth the holding, becauſe as yet God doth not commit unto us the <hi>true Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> Luke 16. 11. that is, the true and abiding Happineſs, for it is not to be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154355:39"/> had in this World, but in the World to come wherein we ſeek and do expect it. Here then is the mind that hath Wiſdom, to draw off our deſires not only from the Sin and Evil (for we ſhould be perfectly liſtleſs and dead as to them. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you the Body is dead becauſe of Sin,</hi> Rom. 8. 10.) But alſo our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhould be drawn off utterly, even from the lawful neceſſary and indifferent things of this World. We ſhould be as if we uſed them not, temperate in all things and get above them. We are commanded, not only to commit any unclean thing. But not ſo much as to touch the unclean thing. Which is ſtanding as much at a diſtance from it as well as we can. So the Word of God, which is very pure, hath provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of Sin, and to abſtain from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Evil, to take this care, even as to prevent the firſt beginnings, riſe, and occaſion of Sin or Evil.</p>
            <p>Thus to Hate and Strip off the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh, as is before explained; and to lay aſide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us; and to reſiſt unto Blood ſtriving againſt Sin, all thoſe Expreſſions come to one and the ſame thing. That is, to ſet up again Innocency and Holineſs in the Soul, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> (by whoſe Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion many were made Sinners) loſt and defaced them. And this is to ſet the Soul in Order before we die, or before ſhe goes out of the Body. It being a taking care that nothing is wanting in her, as indeed it would be a very great want, if ſhe was not renewed again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of him who created her, that is, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>
            <p>It hath been aforeſaid, That to ſet our Bodies in Order was that they might be made free from Sin, for an Holy Body is an orderly Body: Even ſo it is here an <hi>Holy Soul is an orderly Soul,</hi> or to get Holineſs (which is the Image of God) ingrafted and implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154355:40"/> in her, is to ſet the Soul in order, for then it is meet for his Acceptance, who is the Father of Spirits and Lover of Souls. Inaſmuch as Holineſs is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and every like loves its like. <hi>With the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure.</hi> What ſets the Body in Order, as Holineſs doth that, the ſame Holineſs doth ſet the Soul in Order alſo, for they are both united in one and make up the ſame Man, and they deſire the ſame end, which is Happineſs, <hi>The High way to which is the way of Holineſs.</hi> The Body indeed muſt go through more Alterations, and it ſhall be raiſed up again to partake of Happineſs of Miſery. According to this very ſame Truth and Obſervation, <hi>Paul</hi> prays by the Spirit; <hi>And the very God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God, your whole Spirit and Soul and Body be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Faithful is He that calleth you who will do it,</hi> 1 Theſſ 5. 23, 24. Good God? What comfortable and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Words are here? From this Place of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved blameleſs, and from what we read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>Of being made free from Sin, ye have your Fruit unto Holineſs:</hi> We ſee hence, that Sin and Holineſs are as Incompatible Things as Darkneſs and Light. They are perfectly and properly contraries; the Nature of which is to expel one another; and one ſucceeds the other, for as when the Sun ſets and the Light goes off from the Earth, then Darkneſs comes and ſucceeds. And ſo when the Sun ariſes again, it drives off Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Face of the Earth; ſo it is as to Sin and Holineſs: There is no arriving at Holineſs without being made free from Sin: As again when Holineſs goes off or is defaced, then Sin ſucceeds and creeps in of courſe.

And therefore, they are for a kind of Life, which is made up (as they faſhion and imagine to themſelves) of a mixt medly of Sin and Holineſs (as twilight is made up of Darkneſs and Light) and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But God anſwers ſuch by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Woe unto them that are wiſe in their own Eyes, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in their own ſight;</hi> as to think to compound the matter with God. No ſuch matter. For He that commanded, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy Land with divers kinds of Seeds,</hi> nor yet <hi>make a Garment of Linſey Woolſey;</hi> when ſuch a judicial Law was given forth of old Time, the Holy Ghoſt hereby ſignifies even in theſe days, that God will never accept of ſuch a <hi>medly,</hi> or mixt kind of Goodneſs or Righteouſneſs, as is made up of Sin and Holineſs, which is properly no Goodneſs or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs at all. As it is written, <hi>But they like men have tranſgreſſed the Covenant,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 7. That is, it was like and ſuch as could be expected from them. Even
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154355:41"/> ſo this ſort of mixt medly Goodneſs or Righteouſneſs, is like Mans Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, which is a corrupt and imperfect thing at beſt; and that <hi>our Righteouſneſs</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6. which is as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> which People are to be ſtripped utterly off to ſet their Souls in Order before they die; or otherwiſe God will not accept them. For that is an offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and He commands to get behind him, what ſavours of Men. But God hath yet much more clearly anſwered all theſe Imaginations and Devices of Men in that Goſpel Command and Direction, <hi>As He which hath called you is Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. Be ſure to take in here the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, As, and then as to this Point, we will purſue the ſame Reaſoning which the Apoſtles uſes in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes, foraſmuch then as ye know that God is Holy, without the leaſt mixture or tincture of Sin or evil. As Chriſt the Lamb was without Blemiſh and without Spot, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. it muſt follow of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that none is Holy as He which hath called you is Holy, if there be a mixture or tincture of Sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and as the ſame Holy God our Father, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of Perſons judgeth of every Mans Works, it follows of neceſſity alſo, that He will never accept of ſuch a kind of Holineſs in any Man or Woman what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, where Sin or Evil make up any part thereof. Though here alſo, if in our Holineſs there ſhould not be any tincture or ſavour of Sin or Evil (which alſo will be waſhed away in the Blood of the Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh before it is right and meet for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of God) we may be indeed amazed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and ask the Queſtion, who then will be ſaved?

And though ſomething may be done towards that here on this Earth, by their working together with the Grace of God which He gives unto them, till they in a manner empty all the Lees and Sedement out of the Veſſels. But as to the taſte, ſmell and ſcent of the Cask (here with Reverence be it ſpoken) Chriſt muſt give his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate helping hand; that the Soul may appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cloathed in the Righteouſneſs of his Son. <hi>And be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith, not as though I had already attained, either were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but I follow after,</hi> Phil. 3. 9, 12.</p>

Yet here again on the other hand, it is ſo much the more hard to Preach thereon, inaſmuch as Preaching the Word, ſhould be in a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher ſtrain, above the level of the uſual Talk and Thoughts of common People; for it ſhould make known ſuch things which are not commonly known al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

It is hence demonſtratively evident that it doth belong to all, becauſe the reaſon thereof doth ſenſibly and evidently belong to all, <hi>Thou ſhalt die and not live,</hi> For if any Man or Woman is exempted or priviledged from Death and from being liable unto it, then indeed theſe words do concern <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> who afterwards died, but not him or her. But it being moſt certain (for nothing is ſo ſure as Death) that all muſt die, therefore of neceſſity theſe words of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 11. are a Command and Inſtruction, they are for the Learning and Admonition of every one of us <hi>upon whom the ends of the World are come.</hi> And as Jeſus Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples and Followers, <hi>What I ſay unto ye, I ſay unto all, watch.</hi> From whence it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that that word of his did appertain to the whole Multitude that followed him as unto the Twelve; from hence it will appear alſo, that what the Lord, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Preſerver of all Mankind, ſaid unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is as much and the very ſame, for we are to take and receive it all one, as if the Lord God ſhould ſpeak to every Son and Daughter of Men that were Deſcendants from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> whom <hi>He bath Created and calls them all by Names.</hi> Set your Houſes ſeverally in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for ye ſhall die and not live.</p>
            <p>It is as certain and unavoidable that we ſhall die, as that we now live. We of our ſelves could not poſſibly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154355:48"/> hinder our ſelves from coming forth into life and the light of the Living. For when and as ſoon as we were ready and ripe for the bringing forth, we ſtruggled in the Womb, and the God of Nature ordered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a way for our coming forth from thence, neither is it in the Knowledge or Power of the <hi>Embryo</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant to ſtrangle or ſuffocate it ſelf in the Womb, or of it ſelf (for it is done by the Mother or ſome other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accident) to paſs away as the untimely Fruit of a Woman; neither hath it Strength or Underſtanding immediately after it is brought forth to kill or deſtroy it ſelf. And as it grows up towards Manhood, there is implanted an Inſtinct, Self-Preſervation and Abhorrence of Diſſolution. From whence it appears on one hand how God our inviſible Creator (who during all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy doth <hi>bind up and ſtrengthen our Arms though too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny know it not)</hi> for it is not the Nurſe or Mother, but God only who gives that care and compaſſion to the Nurſe or Mother (in adminiſtring of help and doing of benefits God acts through the Creatures) and even he acts through them whilſt they are doing of it.

And indeed without an Almighty Power (who worketh and we ſee him not) that Ordereth, it could never be that ſo Noble and Excellent a Creature ſhould proceed from ſuch a mean beginning. The Fathers according to the Fleſh do nothing at all towards the infuſion of the Soul (which is pure and only the Creation of God) and as for the viler part, the Body, they do no more towards it by the act of Generation, than the Husband-man doth to make the Corn grow, by his ſcattering the Grain in the Earth. They are but Inſtruments in the hands of God, and by the meanneſs of them (if the blinded World can ſee ſo much) he doth the more magnifie his own Power. He might have Created all Mankind as he did the firſt immediately out of the Earth in fulneſs of Stature, or to grow up as Trees and Vegetables. But by the ſame Wiſdom whereby he made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he hath ordained this only way of coming into the World.</p>

               </gap>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it is always expreſſed by theſe five or ſix manner of words, <hi>Dying, Deceaſing, Departing, Yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Ghoſt, Gathering to his Fathers, Falling aſleep.</hi> All which tend to one and near the ſame ſignification, and ſo it doth if there be any other Phraſe or Form of ſpeech to expreſs Death by. <hi>And it came to paſs as her Soul was in departing, for ſhe died,</hi> Gen. 35. 8. which was ſpoken of <hi>Rachel.</hi> And ſo when <hi>Elijah</hi> was to raiſe the Widows dead Son, <hi>He ſtreched himſelf upon the Child three times, and cried unto the Lord and ſaid, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this Child's Soul come into him again,</hi> 1 Kings 17. 21. In the Margent there, it is, into his inward parts. Beſides theſe two plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scriptures which do prove and confirm the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, to this give all the Prophets and Scripture witneſs, That <hi>Death is nothing elſe but a going out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partue of the Soul from the Body.</hi> When the Soul, or Ghoſt or Spirit is yielded up and committed and returns to that God who gave it. And when the Holy Ghoſt Phraſeth it by falling aſleep, thereby it would ſet forth that little pain or difficulty which is therein. For they die in like manner, and make no more of it than when we take our ordinary reſt by ſleep in our Beds. This is commonly the Portion and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of the Godly and Righteous, that they go out of this Body with Peace of Conſcience and Peace towards God; in which ſame ſence that ſaying of the Diſciples is true, <hi>Lord, if he ſleepeth he ſhall do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which will be ſo as to the future State, if it be real Sleep and perfect Peace, and not the Slumberings only of falſe Preſumption. But then as in Sleep we do not ſpeak or act, as when we are awake, nor yet do we think clearly (for Dreaming is but a kind of confuſed Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) inaſmuch as Death alſo doth take away the uſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154355:51"/> of thoſe faculties, which in ſleep are only ſuſpended for a time, therefore becauſe that in this reſpect and for this reaſon it hath ſome reſemblance and likeneſs to ſleep, the Spirit of God doth ſometimes ſo compare and call it. In Death the Soul is actually gone out of the Body, but in ſleep it ſeemeth only to lie a little more ſtill. Again, the Body is as the Houſe or Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Soul is the Inhabitant or Tenant thereof; and as when that leaves it there is nothing ſeen but bare Walls, and not any thing that hath life within. So the Body is evidently ſeen to be but a meer Trunk, Carcaſe or Lump of Clay, when the Soul which is the life and did give it Beauty and ruddy colour (which alſo doth vaniſh with it) is gone out and departed from it.</p>

Thou Ignorant Perſon, I do here ſay and affirm, then it is that we ſee moſt of all when Death hath deſtroyed all our Opticks and power of ſeeing, and our Eyes are ſunk into our Head. I will prove and demonſtrate it from this very Similitude of Things. Do not we ſee more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154355:52"/> when we have the full and whole ſight of a thing, than when we look at or upon it only through a Crevice, Hole or Chink? Do not they ſee more who are at full liberty in the open Air and clear Sun-ſhine, than they who only peep or look through the Grate or little Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a dark Priſon? Yes they do in both inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Even ſo the Soul when ſhe was in the Priſon of the Body (bring my Soul out of Priſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 7. ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt)</hi> it only then looks through two little holes under the Eye-lids. But when this Soul is brought out of Priſon, as it is by Death and Diſſolution of the Body, when the Chains and Fetters of Fleſh are knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, then the Soul is ſight all over and throughout, and nothing at all hinders her ſight as from the place of her Habitation. At preſent it looks through the two Windows or Caſements of the Body, like the <hi>Mother of</hi> Siſera <hi>looking out at a window,</hi> Judges 5. 28. for as when we look through a Perſpective-Glaſs, the Perſpective-Glaſs of it ſelf is blind and ſees nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For to ſee the thing it ſelf when it approaches nigh, and is actually come, is no more than only this, as if you ſhould ſee one go out of an Houſe to another Place, or as we ſee and feel our ſelves, when we are upon going and moving from one place to another. Even ſo Death is no more than a going or moving from out of this World into another World; or rather in more Propriety and Truth of Expreſſion, into another room of the ſame Houſe. For it is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, but another part of this World; the Earth being but the leaſt, even not ſo much as the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of the Creation of God. We can better underſtand, than we can ſee what I am now going to ſpeak of. For when the Breath of Man goeth forth in his Death, 'tis not ſo viſible as ſmoke that aſcendeth up. Nay, as long as it ſends forth Breath, it lives.

And yet it comes to paſs, that as the Creature lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his back or ſide, his Soul goes up towards Heaven,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154355:54"/> it returning to the God that gave it. And as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel aſcended in the flame, even ſo the Soul expires and goes out in the Breath, and we ſee it not. But the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof</hi> (but thou doſt not ſee it) <hi>and canſt not tell, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</hi> So it may be truly reaſoned and conceived of the Soul or Spirit. The Soul did actuate the Body, whilſt it was therein; and we did Hear, See, Taſte, hear and feel the Operations and Life thereof; but we cannot tell exactly the particular Place from whence it came (from God and Heaven in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) neither can we tell the particular Place where it goes, only in the General, that it is to return to God, and to appear before him in Judgment, and from thence to go away into Everlaſting Puniſhment, or into Life Eternal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 46. But further, as to the exact Place, Manner, Time, we cannot tell ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it particularly as it is. Again, <hi>As thou knoweſt not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the Bones do grow in the womb of her that is with Child, even ſo thou knoweſt not the works of God who maketh all,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 5. We know not which way the Spirit came into the Infant whilſt it was in the Womb, by Creation and Infuſion from God in the General; neither do we know which way it takes, as now we know Roads or Paths. When the Breath of Man goes forth, and he returns to his Earth, his Spirit or Soul aſcends up above the Clouds into the upper Parts of the World, as may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from the Light and aſcending Nature thereof, as the ſame is in Smoke or Fire. We may alſo perceive ſomewhat thereof, whilſt ſhe is in the Body by liftings up of Spirit.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou knoweſt not the Way of the Spirit, nor yet the Works of God who maketh all.</hi> Even
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154355:54"/> ſo it is not to be expected, that I ſhould ſo make it known, even from the Law and the Teſtimony, and from the Light that is given me from thence, and ſo deſcribe what it is to ſee Death, as People will find when they come ſeverally to ſee and feel Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Then they ſhall more clearly perceive the Truth of what hath been afore written, when they ſhall in their individual Perſons be brought down to the People of old Time. It is well, if in our Searching and Learning thereof, we come ſomewhat near to the Truth. By what hath been aforeſaid, a clear Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, Notion or Knowledge may be had what Death is or what it is to dye; even for the Soul to go away of out of the Body. And becauſe, it muſt after Death go to Judgment, and from thence it ſhall go further into Everlaſting Puniſhment, or into Life Eternal: Hence doth ariſe that doubt and fear of Soul, which of theſe places it ſhall go away into. As to this, how to obtain the one and avoid the other, to partake of the Bleſſing and eſcape the Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſame and this only is or ought to be the end of all Books or Sermons. I am ſure, it is the only intent of the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>According to the Method and Favour which God afforded unto old <hi>Simeon,</hi> we gather hence, that it is a very great Bleſſing and diſtinguiſhing Mercy of God; for he doth not vouchſafe this favour unto all but only to his Elect, neither doth he deal ſo with every ſort of People, to have this revealed and manifeſted unto them, that they ſhall not ſee Death before they ſee the Lord's Chriſt. It is reported of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Murdered in the Senate-Hoaſe, that he did
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154355:55"/> ſee the Apparition of himſelf in the form of a dead Man; at which ſight (although he was a Mighty Man of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) he was ſtrangely aſtoniſhed and ſtruck with fear. For ſo terrible was this ſight of Death unto him, that he did exceedingly fear and quake. And truly well he might; for he was an Heathen and Infidel, and we can apprehend by the Goſpel Revelation what will becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of ſuch after Death. But our good old <hi>Simeon</hi> hy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Lord's Chriſt before, was ſufficiently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and fortified againſt the ſight of Death. The reaſon whereof ſtands on this wiſe; for as when the Chick ſees the Kite or Hawk that would devour it; if ſhe can then run under the Hens wings into the Cub, ſhe is ſafe, for as the Hen was inſtrumental at firſt to give it Life and Being, ſo ſhe will preſerve it. Even ſo it is here, by ſeeing the Lord's Chriſt, who is appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely called the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> Acts 3. 15. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul, or the Soul that is Chriſt's, runs and makes to Chriſt who promiſes and will perform it alſo, <hi>I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Children togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r even as a Hen gathereth her Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under her wings,</hi> Mat. 23. 37. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his Feathers and under his wings thou ſhalt truſt, his Truth ſhall be thy Shield and Buckler,</hi> Pſal. 91. 3. Then let Death and the Devil come to deſtroy that Soul if they can. Here Chriſt is greater in Power and Might, for aſmuch then as the Children are partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame; that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil. And deliver them who through fear of Death were all their life-time ſubject to Bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Simeon</hi> was one example to confirm this Truth; for he being by the Lord Chriſt delivered from the fear thereof, was not ſo aſtoniſhed thereat as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was, or as other natural ungodly People now-a-days are. Who though they name of Chriſt, yet they have no Benefit or Intereſt in him, they being
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154355:55"/> not within the Covenant, and they have no Share nor Lot in this matter.</p>
            <p>Even after Death hath deſtroyed the Body, Chriſt will deſtroy that. Now to deſtroy the Deſtroyer, that is Salvation indeed. Which again will be effected after it hath ſeized and done its worſt and utmoſt upon us. I will Ranſom them from the power of the Grave; whereby it may be underſtood that the Prince of Life will as it were force and command it ſo; for God is greater in Power and Might. <hi>I will Ranſom them from Death.</hi> As he firſt brought us into Life (for it was the Word of God that Created us; and the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rd of God is Chriſt and Chriſt is the Word of God) and made us liable unto Dying and Death, ſo he will reſcue and bring us up from it again. <hi>O Death I will be thy Plagues; O Grave I will be thy Deſtruction.</hi> Death hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore a Plague unto us, and the Grave hath deſtroyed and crumbled our Body into duſt, when before it was ſafe and entire Fleſh and Blood. But God and Chriſt will in this ſence <hi>Repent himſelf for his Servants;</hi> and he will Plague this Plague and Deſtroy this Deſtroyer. So that it ſhall be returned upon him and ſaid, <hi>O thou Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Deſtructions are come to a perpetual end,</hi> Pſal. 9. 6. That is, when the very ſame things, which ſeem to be deſtroyed and come to nothing, are raiſed up into Life and Being again, never more to turn into Corruption, nor yet to be ſubject unto Deſtruction. All this ſtands ratified and confirmed with this kind of Speech, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 14. whereby is ſhewn forth the Immutability and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <p>And when all theſe things ſhall ſo be, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in Victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24. which very words

               </gap> that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and pleaſe God, ſo you would abound in it more and more, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 1. Truly, God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean Heart,</hi> Pſal. 73. 1. He is good to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind indifferently and in the general; but the mixt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154355:56"/> do not altogether ſo much diſcern his goodneſs. For if they did, they would never carry themſelves ſo Evil, Rebellious, and Deſpiſing towards him as now they do. But in an eſpecial manner God is good to ſuch as are of a clean Heart or clean of Heart. And here reciprocally again, thoſe who are of a clean Heart do behold and know the Goodneſs of God more than the common ſort of People do. For whereas on the other worſe ſide, one ſin retained and dwelling in a Man, is the Root that <hi>beareth Gall and Wormwood,</hi> and is the cauſe of all that Alienation from and Enmity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God (none being Enemies to him but through their own wicked works.) So again, on the other hand, this <hi>cleanneſs of heart,</hi> is like the pulling or rubbing of filth, filmn or ſcales from our Eyes, in order to help our Eye-ſight; or in order that we may ſee clearly. For as aforeſaid, every like loves its like. <hi>An Holy God loves</hi> and <hi>accepts of an Holy Soul:</hi> So here again it is, there being a proportionableneſs and ſuitableneſs herein, a clean Heart knows this propoſition better than others, God is good. A clean Heart ſees farther than another kind of Heart; for it can ſee God through the Cloud. It can ſee the goodneſs of God not only in the Land of the Living, but alſo when it walks through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear no Evil (why ſo?) for thou art with me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. A clean Heart doth ſee a good God, yea and a ſweet God even through the darkneſs and bitterneſs of Death.</p>
            <p>I have read it as a ſaying of thoſe whom they call the Wittier ſort of Atheiſts, that People in the general are afraid of Death, as Children are afraid to walk in the dark for fear to meet Hobgoblings; which we Men know there is no ſuch thing; and from thence they would ground their Imaginations or Dictates of Unbelief.

There is little reality in it; for it is not properly a thing or Being as the Logicians and <hi>Metaphyſicians</hi> ſay: But only a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Thing and a Privation of a Being. And that is only as to the Body; which is as the breaking of a Shell towards the hatching or bringing forth of a Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; or as a Woman when ſhe is in Travel hath Pain and Anguiſh, till the bringing forth of her Child, But after that is born ſhe remembers no more the Pain or Anguiſh for joy that a Child is born into the World. Even ſo through the Pain and Languiſhing of Death the Soul is born and comes forth into the inviſible World, and ſhe remembers no more the Pangs and Throws and Anguiſh ſhe felt by the Body dropping from her, as ſhe came through the Gate of Death, and now ſhe is in an Happy and Bleſſed State.

And whereas he that <hi>keeps Chriſt's Sayings, ſhall never ſee Death,</hi> John 8. 51. Yet they do not keep and obey that laſt Commandment which Chriſt Jeſus is Recorded to have given, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently comprehenſive and of greateſt concernment of all the reſt, <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hath commanded us,</hi> Matth. 28. 20.

Do not ſome break or rather neglect thoſe his leſſer Commandments concerning Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; which he commanded to do in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. Theſe are leſſer Commandments (which are only the poſſitive outward Duties or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Religion) in compariſon to the greater things of the Law which concern intrinſick Good or Evil, Right or Wrong. Again, doth another ſort obſerve ſtrictly the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Juſtice, and Mercy? For it hath been obſerved of thoſe who are called Rigid Strict Presbyterians; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if you charge any of them cloſely and talk with them of theſe things, they have a parcel of Sayings and Excuſes (as indeed all Sin and Tranſgreſſion hath its excuſe: There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo bad in the World, but ſomewhat may be ſaid for it) Diſtinctions and Traditions of their own whereby they would make the Commandments of God of none effect. So it is evident, they break one of his leaſt Commandments and teach Men ſo.

               </gap>rward thoſe good Motions and Thoughts he puts and infuſes into our Souls from time to time, ſo as to obey and do according to them. For upon our doing or not doing of this doth depend and turn the Salvation or Deſtruction of Men. If we would thus give up our ſelves wholly and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and continually to follow the Guidings and Leadings of our God, he would at length ſo order and effect the matter unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo it would go on and ſucceſſively till every Thought is brought into Captivity unto the Obedience of Chriſt. Mark here how it is ſaid, every Thought, and not ſome Thoughts only. For leſs than this God will not accept of, and until this be done in him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154355:62"/> no Man or Woman can be certain of their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or make their Calling and Election ſure.</p>
            <p>From hence we may ſee by the way how vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from and above are God's Thoughts over Mens Thoughts. For according to the Judgment and Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the World they are good Chriſtians and good People, who are good only in ſome things and now and then do a few good deeds. But let the ſame Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple talk what they will in Slanders and Reproaches and falſe Sayings, let them ſpeak Vanity every one unto his Neighbour, or with flattering Lips or a double Heart, there is no great notice taken of this. Do we not this very day ſee with our Eyes and hear with our Ears, that the Strain and Courſe of the World goes on near at this rate? And then farther as to Thoughts, here the Heart of every Man is deep. It is Univerſally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that Thoughts are free, and let them have but a fair outſide Religious Converſation, (for the Multitude and Generations of People have been outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God all along) they ſhall paſs well enough in the eſteem of the World. Although in their Heart they work wickedneſs and their <hi>Thoughts are Thoughts of Iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 59. 7. which is thinking things that are not equal. But in oppoſition and contradiſtinction to all this God is not as Man but above Man. <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways my ways ſaith the Lord: for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> His Word at preſent (much more will his future Judgment and Retribution for this is grounded upon the other) takes notice and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of every Thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. And if this Word of God be continually Preached and made known to the Heart and Conſcience it will not let it reſt and be at quiet until every Thought is brought into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity unto the Obedience of Chriſt. His Word which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154355:62"/> is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, doth more mind what is within than what is without the Man. <hi>O Jeruſalem waſh thine Heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be clean, how long ſhall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Jer. 4. 14. Hence it appears that it is not ſufficient barely to ſtop the hand or ceaſe from the outward act of wickedneſs, but the Heart is to be waſhed from it before we can be ſaved. Again, how very few among the called Chriſtians do make a Conſcience of vain Thoughts? Or to whom vain Thoughts are a grief and a burden, ſo as to cruſh and not give way unto them when they are ſo? But they abſtain from them as much as ever they can. And they do not only ſay ſo with a parcel of cuſtomary words for there is a faſhionable kind of Religious talk, when they do not feel the ſame inwardly, but they do not ſenſibly find it ſo in them. And then they are meer complainers only, <hi>O my leanneſs!</hi> O the Vanity and Corruption of my Heart! Or ſuch like, but they ſtand ſtill and do not mend, nor endeavour to get rid of thoſe vain Thoughts.</p>
            <p>As God underſtandeth our Thoughts afar off, and hath appointed his Word as a Rule and Regulator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo there is <hi>not a word in my Tongue, but lo, Lord thou knoweſt it altogether.</hi> Here alſo the <hi>Law of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, converting the Soul,</hi> Pſal. 19. 7. And as it reaches to the very bottom, ſo it extends unto and gives its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders and Rules for the Government of and Faſhioning and Framing aright all his Thoughts, Words and Actions. As indeed it would be uſeful to ſhew it particularly. <hi>If any Man among you ſeemeth to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and bridl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo it is of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Slanders, Back-bitings and Whiſperings; if they do not make a Conſcience to refrain from every idle and vain (and much more from every falſe) word; <hi>For of every idle Word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judgment:</hi> In a word, unleſs they do take heed to their ways that they offend not with their Tongue, Alas! How very few do all this even among the Profeſſors and Religious alſo? Let them make what pretences, appearances and ſhew they will by going conſtantly to the Exerciſes and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion, and by obſerving all the Acts, Times and Seaſons of outward Worſhip, both in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, Family, Cloſet or Chamber, yet all their Religion is vain.</p>
            <p>Truly, there is more that goes to the making up of Good, Perfect, and thorough Chriſtian, than we do at firſt think and are aware of; and ſo to conſtitute the Pure and Undefiled, the Sincere, Real, Inward and Univerſal Religion. Which laſt Epithet, Univerſal, is fitly added as comprehenſive of all the reſt; as alſo to diſtinguiſh and know it from the Partial Religion of the Multitude; for theirs is a Religion in ſome things and not in all things. There is a great deal more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be indeed a meet Partaker of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, than is to make one only a Member of the Viſible Church here on Earth; for to that is required no more than their coming to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e place of Worſhip and bringing their Bodies with them. And People will find (I do hereby warn and teſtifie that they do not diſcern it then only when it is too late and when the door is ſhut) that there is more to be done, and that it is an harder and longer work to get admiſſion and entrance into Heaven, than barely to go to Church or to ſuch a Congregation every Sabbath, nay though it ſhould be every week day throughout their Life; or then to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154355:63"/> ſay their accuſtomary Prayers which too many count it dull, tedious and weariſome enough. For moſt true it is, that at the day of Judgment it will be ſeen of many, who ſhall not then only at that moment, cry, Lord, Lord, but they alſo did ſay, Lord, throughout all their foregoing life in an accuſtomary manner of outward Worſhip and Prayer; to whom God ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>I never knew ye, Depart from me ye that work Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Matth, 7. 21. 23. Now the working iniquity ſignifies the doing thoſe things which are not Equal. And ſo it will be, depart from me ye that have lived in the continued Breach of any of my leaſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Even at that day of general and final Judgment (notwithſtanding the preſent heart-burnings, and ſelf-juſtifyings of the Religious) <hi>The Lord will ſhew who are his, and who is Holy, and will cauſe him to come near unto him, even whom he hath choſen, he will cauſe to come near unto him,</hi> Numb. 16. 5. I do really believe and am verily perſuaded, for I gather as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and particularly from that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongſt Men, is abomination in the ſight of God,</hi> Luke 16. 15. That many People will be damned, and go to Hell; who are now accounted and have the Character of very Religious, Civil and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People, Fair Conditioned and Good Neighbours. As again, ſeveral will be ſaved whom the World doth revile and caſt out their Name as Evil, in like manner as their Fore-fathers did to the Prophets, Impoveriſh and Oppreſs, yea it may be, Impriſon and put them to Death. As it was ſaid of <hi>Paul, Away with this turbulent fellow, it is not fit he ſhould live.</hi> But how muſt ſuch be aſhamed to ſee thoſe very ſame Souls had in Honour and Rewarded by the Infinite and Glorious God, whom they made and uſed as the filth and off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154355:64"/> and eſteemed as the contemptible ones of the Earth. The Scene will change, and there will then appear another face of things.</p>
            <p>I do the more willingly here put in mind of theſe things for two Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1 ſt. That you may know what to anſwer when your Opinion is asked concerning ſuch an one, of whom perhaps the Multitude is divided, and ſome ſay, <hi>He is a good Man, and others ſay he deceiveth the People.</hi> Some ſay of him that he is a Rogue, Hypocrite or deceived in his Religion. Others are apt to think that he is Sincere, Underſtanding and Conſciencious in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And ſo when you hear a more favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of another ſort, that they are Good Religious People, becauſe they always go to Church or Meeting, and they do ſeveral good Deeds. Here it is well for them if their Goodneſs and Religion is Univerſal. They will <hi>not be aſhamed,</hi> neither in this World nor yet in the World to come, <hi>If they have reſpect unto all God's Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. But in both theſe and ſo in like caſes, we ought to think as near as we can according to the Law and the Teſtimoy and according to the Light that is in them, but let alone all pronouncing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for all Judgment is the Lord's. We are to ſuſpend our Verdict and Judge nothing before the time. For the day cometh when the Lord will manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart, and then ſhall every one have Praiſe of God.</p>
            <p>2dly. I do the more willingly put in mind of theſe things, to quicken, ſtir up, and provoke all that ſhall hear or read theſe Lines, to give all diligence, to uſe their utmoſt Earneſtneſs, Strength, Labour and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and that not only for a fit or ſpurt. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually throughout all their remaining Life, and to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154355:64"/> be ſorry that they had begun to do ſo no ſooner, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe up and be ſaved. For truly, there is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary unto it then People are aware of. It is obſervable, what follows immediately after, <hi>Luke 16, 15. The Law and the Prophets were until John, ſince that Time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and every Man preſſeth into it.</hi> So it is at this very day and hath been all along, the Kingdom of God is preached, and the Word of God is preached for to bring People to that his Kingdom, or to bring People to Heaven. And if you ask every Man or Woman, that ever heard a a Sermon in their Life as there is hardly any one in this Nation, who hath not heard a Sermon, unleſs ſome ignorant Papiſts, who are next door to Atheiſts. Whither they do Hope to go to Heaven? Every one will ſay that they do. But the Scripture here ſaith, <hi>Every Man preſſeth into it.</hi> To explain the very ſence and meaning of that Word, it will be neceſſary to uſe this inſtance and ſimilitude, ſuppoſe that we did ſee or word was brought unto us, that all ſuch an Houſe, wherein was a great Aſſembly of People were on Fire, what running and ſcampering would there be to the doors? And each one would preſs upon another, who could get out firſt. The Parallel place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. eſpecially the Marginal Reading thereof, confirms this very ſame Acceptation and Signification of the Word, for there it is on this wiſe, <hi>And from the Days of John the Baptiſt until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent take it by fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. Which laſt is as much as to ſay, that People are for all by Nature luggiſh, ſo that they would not run and preſs enough of themſelves in ſuch a Caſe of Neceſſity and Danger. But we Miniſters and Preachers of the Word muſt alſo thruſt them on. For ſo it is, the door of the Kingdom of Heaven ſtands, and is held open by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154355:65"/> the Preaching and Miniſtry of the Word. But in as much as the Fathers, where are they? and do the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets live for ever? Both Preachers and Hearers muſt dye the Death. So that the door is not always open to them. And as to this again, the rule i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> certain that if any one doth not in this Life (which is the time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Probation and Trial on this account) do things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſtand before the Son of Man, or to which Heaven is promiſed, unleſs <hi>He doth the Commandments of God, that He may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City;</hi> unleſs People bring forth fruits meet for Repentance, and ſo except Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do things meet for Heaven before they die, they will never go to Heaven after that they die.</p>
            <p>As to that important Queſtion, What we muſt do to be ſaved, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how much we muſt do to be ſaved? Or to get into Heaven? In theſe two foregoing Texts it is ſaid, The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by force. Every Man preſſeth into it. Strive to enter into the ſtreight Gate, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. It hath been obſerved by the learned in that Language, that the Word, ſtrive, in the Original Greek, doth require to put forth the utmoſt Strength, even until we break a Vein and the Blood guſheth forth (which none of the Lazy Formaliſts, meer outward Worſhippers and nominal Chriſtians can pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) and ſo again we read, <hi>That the Righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved.</hi> And indeed throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Goſpel eſpecially, there are ſcattered up and down, ſo many true ſayings of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exceeding difficulty, danger and fear of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment herein, that they who have enquired and ſearched diligently therein of the very Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions of this Salvation, do truly make this return upon their whole ſearch and enquiry of this matter, <hi>That the Kingdom of God is a Pearl of great Price, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154355:65"/> if a Man would buy and obtain, he muſt ſell all that he hath and give for it.</hi> Who knows this better than our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author of this Salvation, and underſtands upon what Terms it is to be had. So we muſt ſell all that we have, all Sin, Evil, and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, which is properly our own: We muſt part with all the Guilt and Corruption, that is in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all that ſavours of Sin, or of our ſelves; and ſo all that ſavours of the World or of the Devil is to be renounced utterly, and we are to diſpoſſeſs our ſelves thereof, in order to have that Pearl of great Price. For leſs than this cannot be to make room for Chriſt to be formed in us. Foraſmuch as he will not dwell with any Evil, or with a Body that is leavened or tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sin. Now if People will not bid up to the Price, which the Lord hath put upon it, they muſt go away without it; they have neither Part nor Lot in this matter; for their Heart is not right and whole in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Behold I have told you before, and I do hereby warn People of as much before hand, againſt the Time they ſhall ſee it fulfilled and found true in the valley of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, that all People will not go to Heaven, who now ſeek to go to Heaven. For many now-a-days talk of Heaven who will never go there. For there will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected at the laſt day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe who have Propheſied in Chriſt's Name, and in his Name have caſt out Devils, and in his Name have done many wonderful Works. One may Preach throughout all his Life unto others, and be a caſt-a-way for all that. For it is equally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Preacher or Miniſter, for a Prieſt or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-Man to be damned, as for any other Perſon. I am to look to this, and to take heed to my ſelf, leaſt the Devil deceive me alſo (O the exceeding ſubtlety of the old Serpent) even whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <p>I have read of one, who was converted and brought over to a moſt Holy, Preciſe and Religious kind of Life, by the Dream of a Night Viſion or by a Voice ſpeaking unto him in his Sleep; that ſuch an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his (naming him by his Name) was really damned.

But if ſuch an one whom the World accounted very Religious, ſhould periſh, Good God! What will become of us, who are not Religious, perhaps to the tenth degree, as he was? This ſhould indeed ſtir us up ſo to run, that we may obtain (as we do deſire it, and fooliſh are they who do not endeavour all that they can after it) to be in all things what God commandeth us, very circumſpect and to abound in all Holy Converſation and Godlineſs, as is poſſible for Mortal Creatures, whilſt in the Fleſh and in this Life to be.</p>

And ſo it is of all meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Prayers, Lip-labour, when the Heart is far from God, with all the outſide Acts of Worſhip and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the inward parts thereof are not joyned with them. <hi>Let them put away their Whoredom, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of their Kings far from me, and I will dwell in the midſt of them for ever,</hi> Ezek. 43. 9. Lip-labour in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is properly <hi>Whoredom;</hi> for it takes away the Heart from God who is the right beloved, and places it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another wrong beloved. And ſo meer and only outſide Worſhip may be truly called the <hi>Carcaſes</hi> of Worſhip, that is, without any Soul, Life or Spirit, therein: Now as we here learn and read, all this muſt be put away for God to dwell in us, and accept of our Worſhip. Our Matters muſt be Good and Right, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the great Rule of Righteouſneſs in Scripture, if ever they will find the leaſt Acceptance or Approbation from God. For He is an Holy God, He is a God of Knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed. And ſo our Worſhip is to be in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip him. But all the Worſhip beſides in the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Worſhip in Tongue or in Body, which is all as nothing, and profits as nothing without the Heart and Spirit going along with it; or any Worſhip in which there is a mixture of Errour, Idolatry or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is an Abomination unto the Lord, and obtains no good from him, but rather brings Wrath and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on the deluded Worſhipper. One falſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154355:68"/> in a Prayer, Sermon or Service, ſpoils the whole Burnt-offering or Sacrifice, as to him that offers it up, I mean as to the Preacher or Miniſter, but the Hearers may <hi>ſeparate the Precious from the Vile,</hi> and not aſſent unto, but diſſent from it, if any falſhood ſhould drop out of his Mouth.</p>
            <p>The ſame holds alike and equally true as to good Works.

Now here it often ſo happens, that an High-way-Man, or one who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Goods unjuſtly gotten, or a Prodigal Spenthrift do now and then by chance, or by way of vain Humour, inconſiderately give a Crown or a Pound to a Poor Body; when perhaps a real Servant of God, or a good Chriſtian doth not give mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt ſumm doth the moſt good to the poor Object, becauſe it is a means to furniſh him with more neceſſaries; whereas the laſt is the better Work, and more acceptable in the ſight of God, who ſeeth the Heart and with what Mind it is. As the latter is done, only out of a ſence of Duty and in Obedience to his Commandments; but the former ſort is done at random or by chance. Or perhaps becauſe even in the moſt Ungodly and Wicked, ſeeing that they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably die and mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor do they receive Inſtructions from the Word of God, where they might ſee how they ought to walk to pleaſe him. I have ſeen it quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory, that the Great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour once took ſome goods wrongfully from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and being troubled in Conſcience for the ſame upon his Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT was the ſaying of <hi>Abigal</hi> unto <hi>David, Yet a Man is riſen to purſue thee and to ſeek thy Soul, but the Soul of my Lord ſhall be bound in the bundle of Life with the Lord thy God,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 29. So the caſe ſtands as to us all. One is riſen up to purſue us and ſeek our Souls; even our Adverſary the Devil (of whom <hi>Saul</hi> was a kind of Type and Signification in Hunting after and Perſecuting of <hi>David,</hi> or rather the Devil acted through <hi>Saul</hi> in it.) <hi>As a roaring Lyon walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And he hath Death and Hell for his Companions; or as two Dogs, the one to catch and the other to deſtroy or make miſerable. But here if we ſee the Lord's Chriſt, or have Chriſt formed within us, he is appoſitely and truly ſtiled the <hi>Prince of Life.</hi> So that then of certain conſequence our <hi>Souls are bound in the bundle of Life with the Lord our
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154355:73"/> God.</hi> This is a great expreſſion containing in it ſelf an unſpeakable benefit. Then it is that we dying Creatures, if we have ſeen the Lord's Chriſt, or have Chriſt formed within us, we are bound up in the bundle of Life with the ever-living God. So that of neceſſity, as fire warms all things that are next unto it and which are capable of warmth, we muſt live alſo. For with thee is the <hi>Fountain of Life, and in thy Light ſhall we ſee Light.</hi> So it may be truly reaſoned alſo, in thy life ſhall we have life. <hi>Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall we be with the Lord.</hi> But when we once ſee the Lord's Chriſt, or rather feel him formed within us and we thus have our Souls bound with the Lord our God in the bundle of Life with the Lord our God, then we which are now dying and going off from the Stage of this Earth, as ſoon as ever we move off from thence, <hi>The Eternal God is our Refuge and underneath are the everlaſting Arms, and he ſhall thruſt out the Enemy before thee,</hi> Deut. 33. 27. This Enemy is the Devil, who was afore ſpoken of to be riſen to ſeek our Souls. Behold how in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner all Scripture is conſonant to it ſelf at the greateſt diſtance of place, and how the goodneſs of God provides beforehand for the ſafety and ſalvation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is his People and Servants. For he hath provided <hi>everlaſting Arms</hi> to reach, receive and catch the Soul in juſt upon its flight and being let out from the Body. And whereas it is ſaid. That <hi>be rideth upon the Heaven in thy help; and in his Excellency upon the Sky;</hi> ſo that he is above the Prince of the power of the Air, who with his Evil Spirits hath his Reſidence or Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereabouts. But we ſhall alſo meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo we ſhall ever be with the Lord; To partake of his Life and Happineſs, his Good and Blef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. And ſo whilſt we are thus continually dying
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154355:73"/> on this Earth, we ſhall thus wait till our change ſhall come. The word of Inſtruction which doth ariſe from hence is, that we ſhould endeavour to be as like God and as like Chriſt as ever we can in all his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Attributes, and Perfections, for ſo far as we are partakers of his Holineſs or of his Image and Likeneſs here, we ſhall be aſſuredly partakers of his Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt die and not live.</hi> There is no need to inſiſt much or enlarge further upon that Subject, Death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, for who knows not this already? Who knows not alſo that we do continually from time to time haſte and approach nearer and nearer unto it? As alſo who knows not that we are in a World of Tranſitory Periſhing and Dying things; but Faith teaches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs that all this is in order to that which <hi>ſhall remain.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 22. and is Eternal and Life for evermore. Accordingly we find and feel within our ſelves (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are ſubject to Mortality) yet thoughts and deſires after Immortality. Which ſame thoughts and deſires can never be in vain, but there is alſo a real Object of Immortality, though as yet it is unſeen, to whom the ſame do relate. There doth ariſe in us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faintneſs and anguiſh at the thorough conſideration of the periſhing nature of things; which is ſenſible and may be perceived. For as when it was told <hi>Saul, To morrow thou ſhalt be with me</hi> (that is, in the ſtate of the dead) then <hi>Saul</hi> fell <hi>ſtraitway all along on the Earth, and was ſore afraid becauſe of the words of</hi> Samuel, <hi>and there was no ſtrength in him.</hi> So it is at the thorough apprehenſion and knowledge of this thing of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Corruption and Mortality we become as of no ſtrength, free among the dead; and we have leſs ſtrength at the thoughts before hand that Death at length will take all ſtrength from us. Becauſe that things by their periſhing do ſeem to be vain, therefore doth ariſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154355:74"/> vexation of Spirit and we could wiſh it were otherwiſe and not ſo. Yea, that it is not ſo we have aſſured hopes. It is uſually now reckoned an enhancement of miſery, when we know better and yet we cannot have and enjoy it, For if one had never known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the worth or goodneſs of ſuch a thing, the diſappointment for miſſing thereof would not have been ſo vexatious. And ſo here it is, God having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in all Men whatſoever ſome knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of enduring Eternal and ſatisfactory things (the ungodly have a little glimpſe or glimmering thereof by natural Underſtanding like him that was born blind who ſaw Men as Trees, but the Godly have a full Light and Sight thereof by Faith) now here when every thing ſeems to periſh and paſs away, and not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie fully; there doth ariſe Anguiſh, Vexation and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Thought in the Creature towards the Creator, as if we were only tantalized, that is, put near what we cannot obtain, or put in expectation of what is not at all: But it is not ſo with us. For only the matter is thus, God doth all things in his own order. The thing is true, though the time appointed for it is long. God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:154355:75"/>
            <p>The whole that Man deſires and would have, is Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Salvation, for if there be any other good thing which he would have or doth wiſh for; it is all comprehended under this word, to be Happy and to be made ſure of it. One defines Happineſs, to be a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or heaping together of all good things. Now if one had all the Happineſs which this World can give, all the Plenty and Variety in each thing, the Bleſſings of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Underſtanding in the firſt place, and then Riches and Honour, and length of Days, even what may ſeem good for the Sons of Men, and whatever his Eyes deſired I kept not from them, I with-held not my Heart from any Joy, beſides that it is all Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. For it doth not at the very time give the Heart and Soul a full and ſincere ſatisfaction; for all thoſe good things put together do not yield it at the very inſtant of Enjoyment. But then farther, the Spirit is vexed, that if they did fully, thoroughly and ſincerely ſatisfie her for the time, as they do not, that ſhe muſt be at length taken away from all theſe things. And ſhe being an Immortal Eſſence, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing but what is Immortal and Eternal alſo, will indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfie her. For in her very Thought, that can be no Happineſs which hath an end. For ſhe knows that her ſelf, though ſhe began to be, will have no end; and therefore ſhe craves earneſtly and groans within her ſelf, and travaileth in pain, like unto that Speech of <hi>Rachel,</hi> Give me Children or elſe I die; give me a Happineſs abiding as long as my ſelf and commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to me; or elſe I had rather die, ceaſe to be, and return unto my firſt nothing. But this is impoſſible from the Decree of God, (who whatever he doth in this kind, he doth it for ever) and it ſhall therefore continue in being as long as himſelf is God, which is for ever and ever. As Jeſus Chriſt, the Lover and Saviour of Souls, did once ſay, <hi>My Kingdom is not of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154355:76"/> this World, for then would my Servants fight for me.</hi> So the Soul may truly ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Happineſs is not of this World; for then would my Servants, my Faculties and Powers ſeek for it here. But the former part is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the two reaſons afore aſſigned, becauſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Happineſs of this World, is neither ſatisfactory nor yet enduring: And the Soul would fain have that which is both. And therefore it is not worth while to give Command or Direction to my Servants, my Powers and Faculties, my Reaſon and Underſtanding, to be wholly employed in ſeeking after them. For indeed we ſhould be no otherwiſe employed about them at all, but only in ſubſerviency and ſubordination to the greater things to come.</p>
            <p>The time would fail me to mention all thoſe manifold Scriptures (which do moſt diſcover the Nature of things of any Book of the World. For who can better know the very Nature and Order of things, than the Word it ſelf which made and eſtabliſhed them) which contain this very ſame Reaſoning and Exhortation, that the Soul is not to have her Happineſs in this World, but to ſeek for it in God, and what he will do for her in the World to come; let us inſtance in two or three, for by the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The firſt to manifeſt and ſhew forth this ſame Truth, is <hi>Heb. 13. 14. For here we have no continuing City, but we ſeek one to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> From which words it may be truly reaſoned and inferred, for here we have no continuing Happineſs, but we ſeek one to come, And then if we conſider <hi>Mich</hi> 2. 10. to which this place of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> hath reference, <hi>Ariſe ye and depart for this is not your reſt.</hi> Both theſe Scriptures put together confirm theſe two Reaſons, wherefore Man's Happineſs is not of this World becauſe that in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, it is not his <hi>Reſt;</hi> for all the things of this World do not give
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154355:76"/> truereſt and full content to the Soul. Again, another parallel place to this is, <hi>Deut. 12. 9. For ye are not yet come to the Reſt and to the Inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you,</hi> Which though it was ſpoken as to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> as a leſs Type and Signification of Heaven, and of that Reſt which remaineth to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; yet from this ſame place it may be ſurely gathered and inferred, that it hath relation princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to that Reſt which is to be had only on the other ſide of the Grave, and that Inheritance I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And we are not as yet come to that Reſt, neither ſhall we ever arrive to that <hi>Reſt</hi> as long as we are on this Earth. As to this the inference is Natural and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing that we cannot have Reſt here, let us ſeek for Reſt elſewhere. For we may ſenſibly obſerve, that our Spirits are always reſtleſs or diſſatisfied about one thing or another. <hi>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea which cannot reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up mire and dirt,</hi> and their reſtleſneſs is becauſe of Sin and Guilt.

Becauſe as yet it doth not go ſo well with the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and his Truth, ſo as to reform and bring the corrupt World into Subjection and Obedience to him as we would have it; and becauſe through that abundant Oppoſition of Satan we cannot bring our good devices to paſs; and for ſuch-like good reaſons.

For indeed Carnal things will not give Reſt; and as for Spiritual things <hi>which is indeed Life and Peace,</hi> and would give Reſt, theſe now we have only in part and in imperfect meaſure and we apprehend them by Faith. Therefore ſeeing that we cannot have Reſt on this Earth,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154355:77"/> the Exhortation ſpeaks on this wiſe, let us ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and endeavour earneſtly to get to Heaven; for there we ſhall be ſure of Reſt.

            <p>To this purport our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes and directs, which I intend as the ſecond great Scripture to confirm the aforeſaid Reaſoning, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Truth. <hi>And I ſay unto you, make unto your ſelves Friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when you fail, they may receive you into everlaſting Habitations,</hi> Luke 16. 9 The whole eight verſes immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going are worthy to be read out at length; and from that Epiphonema which is added at the ſumming up of and concluſion of this Parable or Rehearſal (for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it was a real and true ſtory) <hi>The Children of this World are in their Generation wiſer than the Children of Light;</hi> I have often thought from theſe very words, that if People would do as much for Heaven, as we evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee they do for the World, none would ever miſs thereof. Or at leaſt, ſuch would not miſs thereof who do but as much towards it, as Worldlings now uſually and commonly do for the things of this World: and it is reckoned their Wiſdom, Carefulneſs and Commendation ſo to do. Which indeed it is if they do not ſet their Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and Affection too much upon it. And chiefly, if in their Proſecution and Acquiſition thereof, they make uſe only of thoſe means and things, which are lawful and right and no others. As the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are bigger and higher than the Earth, which is more than ten thouſand fold in both inſtances; again, as Eternity is longer than time, which is more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon than the whole computation of Man's life at Seventy years is more than the twinkling of an Eye; ſo much is Heaven of more worth than the Earth. And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154355:77"/> proportionably there is ſo much the more Reaſon, why People ſhould ſeek after Heaven than Earth, and do more for Heaven, than any do now for the Things of this World. Beſides the abundant and forcible Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which flows from all this; yet this other unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument lies againſt all the Ungodly and Unbelievers, Ignorant and Slothful Perſons in the World, they muſt all unavoidably go off from this Earth; and, whither they will or refuſe, be taken off utterly from tne things of this Earth, and then whoſe will be the things which they have provided? If they anſwer, their Children and Executors. But then I would put them in mind further, that they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls and returning Bodies. Souls which do live the very next moment, after that their Breath goes out of their Body; which alſo muſt be raiſed again, after they have been corrupted in the Duſt of the Earth. And what Care and Proviſion is taken beforehand as to both of theſe? Did they whilſt they had them, make to themſelves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that when they themſelves failed, or againſt the Time when themſelves ſhould fail, theſe might receive them into Everlaſting Habitations?</p>
            <p>But the moſt Men and Women will be found not to have done ſo much. But rather it will be fulfilled as to the Multitude, and the much greater part of the ſeveral Generations and Countreys, what God ſpeaks by the Prophet, <hi>They that depart from me, ſhall be written in the Earth,</hi> Jer. 17. 13. which is a ſad Story, as will appear when we come to open the meaning and ſignificancy thereof. Though perhaps ſeveral Muck-worms and Earthly-minded Men, think that it will not be ill with them if this only ſhall be their doom, becauſe that they love the Earth ſo well, that they could be contented, and not fear to have their Names written in it.</p>
            <p>I have read the Relation of a very Warlike and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154355:78"/> King in his Time, who after many Battels and Conqueſts, and being very proſperous and ſucceſsful therein (from this Example judge none Happy or Safe before their end, but conſider the Proverb, <hi>All is well that ends well.</hi> And make no Judgment or Concluſion concerning Providence, until the whole train, courſe and upſhot thereof is over.) He at length goes to make War with <hi>Tomyris</hi> Queen of the Eaſtern Countrey, and (like that great Captain <hi>Siſera</hi> who fell by the hands of a Woman, according to the doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Events of War) He was overthrown and ſlain by her and her Army. And after he was killed ſhe commanded his Head to be cut off, and to be caſt into a large Veſſel full of Blood for the dead Head to ſwim therein, with uttering this appoſite ſaying thereon, Now <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſatisfie thy ſelf with Blood, which thou haſt ſo long thirſted after. Not much unlike thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Scripture, <hi>He that taketh the Sword, ſhall periſh with the Sword.</hi> As their <hi>Sword hath ſhed Blood, ſo give them Blood to drink.</hi> But that aforementioned was a ſore Proverb, and a ſevere taunting Expreſſion to be uſed to a Dead-mans Head ſwimming in a Veſſel of Blood.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:154355:79"/> although I might be Lord, Proprietor and Owner of ſeveral thouſand Acres of good Land. And ſo would ye alſo, if ye have a true Faith and Knowledge in the revealed Decrees and Diſpenſations of God, and in the Things pertaining to his Kingdom. Though withal it is to be underſtood, as the ſame may be truly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from out of the ſame Scriptures of Truth, none will be condemned at the laſt day meerly or only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He was Rich in this World; and ſo it is contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, none will be ſaved meerly or only becauſe He was Poor in this World. But People will be ſaved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned according as they have done Good or Evil, and according as their Deeds done in the Body were Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or Unrighteous, Juſt or Unjuſt, Equal or Une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, True or Falſe, Acts of Duty and Obedience, or Acts of Sin, or according as they do moſt ſet their Heart and Affections upon God, or the Things of this World.</p>
            <p>I have heard a Man ſpeaking on this Wiſe, <hi>As long as my Poſſeſſions, Goods and Eſtate will ſerve my Time, it is well enough.</hi> Which ſeems to be a fit Expreſſion for one <hi>who hath his Portion in this Life.</hi> And truly this is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the Men of the World go upon, for this makes them ſo eager and deſirous in compaſſing and obtaining them, whether by lawful or unlawful means, whether by right or wrong, Omiſſion of Duty or Commiſſion of Sin. For they imagine and ſay, that the good things of this Life will ſerve for their Time. But in this they do greatly err; for as aforeſaid, themſelves have immortal Souls and immortal Spirits, which exiſt and live the very firſt hour after they are diſlodged from the Body. And ſeeing that the World paſſeth away, and the Luſt and Faſhion thereof; It is hence manifeſt and clear, that they do not, neither will they ſerve their Time. For our Time, or the Time of our ſelves, which is our Souls, is to laſt as long as God himſelf, and to run
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154355:79"/> parallel with the longeſt Line of Eternity, even until Time ſhall be no more, but we are thence launched forth, into the vaſt and infinite Ocean of forever and ever. <hi>Tell them therefore, thus ſaith the Lord God, I will make this Proverb to ceaſe, and they ſhall no more uſe it as a Proverb in Iſrael, but ſay unto them, the days are at hand and the Effect of every Viſion,</hi> Ezek. 12. 23. So when the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord (which alſo includes the Knowledge of the Things pertaining to his Kingdom) as the Waters cover the Sea; there ſhall be no more uſed this kind of ſaying in the Mouths of People, that the things of the Earth, or the things of this World will ſerve their Time, ſo as to laſt as long as themſelves ſhall laſt and endure, for the one are periſhing and corruptible; but themſelves, that is, their Souls are Immortal and Incorruptible.</p>
            <p>Indeed in this Sence they might and ſhould ſerve their Time, by uſing and receiving them to the Glory of God, and according to the Bounds, Rules, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of his Law, that they might be for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and <hi>not hurt of the owners,</hi> as the Wiſe Man inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; and according to this Counſel and Command of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, Make to your ſelves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail they may receive you into Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habitations.</p>
            <p>Rich People ſhould moſt of all much conſider of this; ſo that themſelves may be hereby influenced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded for to do accordingly. For theſe ſenſibly know what a Comfort and Conveniency it is, to have an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Plenty of the good things of the Earth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their hand without their being forced to drudge and labour for them. They ſhould herein Eye the Providence and Diſpenſation of God, as alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, how that they are herein liable to higher and ſtricter accounts, to make unto him for more Talents
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154355:80"/> and Priviledges received from him. But then chiefly, they ſhould lay deeply to Heart, that though they now have ſuch an advantage of Worldly Proſperity; As they find the Comfort and acceptable Reliſh thereof, is it not then deſirable to continue ſo? And therefore, they ſhould take Care and give Diligence, that againſt this fails (for Rich People muſt dye, and when <hi>they die they can carry nothing away with them,</hi> the forty-ninth <hi>Pſalm</hi> is appoſite and pertinent to them) to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of an Happineſs in the higheſt Heavens for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> an Heathen could ſay, whoſe ſaying herein will riſe up in Judgment againſt them, Rich People have the moſt Reaſon to ſerve God of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath been ſo good and bountiful unto them. This is an Argument which the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of in Scripture, from God's Kindneſs and Love, that they ſhould keep in the way of his Commandments, and not turn aſide from them. But contrariwiſe, is it not ſeen? that <hi>Jeſhurun waxed fat and kicked;</hi> that the Rich and Subſtantial, and Chief of the People are the greateſt deſpiſers of God, becauſe they are full and lack nothing. Do they not blaſpheme that worthy Name by the which ye are called? Do they not make a Mock and Jeſt, and Light of the Power of Godlineſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Religion? Though themſelves partly for Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake, and partly for Conſcience-ſake may juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the form and out-ſide thereof. Do we not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be aſhamed of the Words of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel in this adulterous and ſinful Generation?

            <p>A third obſervable Scripture, which is to confirm and eſtabliſh the Truth and Reaſoning of our whole preſent Diſcourſe, as indeed it all comes to one and the ſame thing, even to be provided of a well-being elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as ſoon and immediately after we are deprived of a Being at all as to this Life, and on this Earth. This Scripture is contained in all theſe three Verſes put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no help. His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth, in that very day his Thoughts periſh. And then it immediately ſucceeds, Happy is He that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe Hope is in the Lord his God,</hi> Pſalm 146. 3, 4, 5. To ſay abſolutely, that there was no help in Man would ſeem falſe and untrue; for many times Man our Fellow-Creature is helpful unto us in ſeveral inſtances. He that giveth an Alms is help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inſtrumental to preſerve Life. But as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh elſewhere, <hi>Her Merchandize ſhall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat ſufficiently, and for durable cloathing,</hi> Iſa. 23. 18. ſo as to <hi>help ſufficiently,</hi> and proportionably to its need and for <hi>durable help,</hi> in this ſence, <hi>there is no help in Man.</hi> For in the Caſe here put, when the Time comes that his Breath muſt go forth, can all the Men or Phyſicians in the World
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154355:81"/> help or hinder it? I trow not. Can all the Kings of the Earth with all their Armies, protect any one whatever from a Mortal and inward Diſeaſe? In no ſort. And then the help of Man is not durable. He may help now and then for a Time, but he cannot help always. Now ſeeing that we have within us an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Soul which may and will be happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which will be ſaved or damned, after it is diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Body; here if ſhe ſhould cry out as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 47. 7, 8. They can no more ſave her after ſhe is gone out of the Body, then they could preſerve her from going out of the Body, when the appointed and ſet Time is come. Then <hi>Happy is He that hath the God of Jacob for his help.</hi> In him alone is our help, in him alone is our Salvation, and whoſe Hope is in the Lord his God, or who hath Hope well-grounded that God will ſave her; to whom God will prove helpful, and the Object of his Deſire or Hope, and not a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Judge, or a Terrour to us in the Day of Evil. The ſhort of the Matter is this, and herein is the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Mortal Creature; if at the inſtant, when his Breath goeth forth, his Spirit is committed into thy Hands O God, who art ever-living.

Is there any one that doth not deſire to live comfortably and pleaſantly in this World? No, every Mothers Son doth deſire this: If we would receive into our Minds the Knowledge and Faith thereof, God hath implanted into every Man and Woman the ſame earneſt deſire after Heaven, as now He or She hath after Life and Happineſs. For ſeeing that by the Decree of God, and from the very order and eſtabliſhment of Things, we muſt live for ever (for we ſhall always remain in Being, although we muſt go through the valley and ſhadow of Death, or through the Poſtern-Door or Gate of Death) I ſay again, it is altogether as natural and reaſonable to deſire to be Happy after Death, all one as it is ſenſibly deſired to be Happy before Death. And as in order to this, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to uſe ſuch and ſuch means: ſo to be Happy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. It is abſolutely neceſſary to go in the way, and to do all thoſe things which God hath chalked out and ſhewed in his written Word; and there is alike and greater Reaſon, yea ten thouſand times more as that is as much longer and of greater concern, that we ſhould comply with and do thereafter. As the hungry craves after Food, the ambitious Honour, the ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt

And it is but reaſonable, that He ſhould do ſo much towards the obtaining of them, I ſay infinitely more, as the Children of this World do for the things of this World, or otherwiſe they will never be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light, and Heirs of Life and Immortality. But they will come ſhort of the future great and good things of God; for theſe alſo are ſet forth by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame things in a greater degree, than what is ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly followed after here. So that it is evident, where they are believed and received, they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men; for the very ſame Conſiderations do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſwade, and alſo prevail with Men as to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
            <p>In a Word, the practice of univerſal Religion (which is the fear of God and keeping his Commandments, or rather the confirming of all the Words of his Law and Goſpel by our doing of them) comes and ſtands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with ſuch uncontroulable Arguments, that where they are received into the Mind and pondered in the Heart, they muſt of Neceſſity weigh down, incline and ſway the Mind towards God, and the good things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his Kingdom. And after all, were there not a Devil and Satan, the unſeen Enemy of Mankind, who yet for all deceiveth the Nations, and deceiveth the whole World: It would be, if not morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet highly improbable, that not ſo much as one of the Sons or Daughters of Men ſhould periſh.

            <p>I have many times thought, what a brave World we ſhould have, if all Miniſters and Preachers were as Godly and Holy, and did <hi>ſtand in God's Counſel and on his ſide</hi> (as it becometh his Ambaſſadours) all one when they are out of their Pulpits, as they ſeem when they are in them. And ſo if all other People were as Good and Religious at their ſeveral Houſes throughout each Week-day, as they appear to be in the Church or Congregation on Sabbath-days, ſuch indeed ſhould be the Chriſtian Life. For though indeed (to our ſhame be it ſpoken) even the Religious alſo give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to a worldly kind of Spirit, and to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of Talk and Diſcourſe, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things to all Men. And when we converſe with the People of the World, they cannot bear with and reliſh Divine and Heavenly Things to be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talked of with them, but they are Melancholy and Irkſome thereat. So that we muſt come over to their kind of talk, or have in a Manner no talk with them. But here it were rather to be wiſhed and deſired that their Hearts were ſo renewed and ſanctified, that their chief delight was in that Diſcourſe, which relates to their bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhall never End. And that they did or could once come to find more real ſatisfaction in what is good to the uſe of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, than in the other kind which recreates only for the preſent, and is concerning thoſe things which in a ſhort time are to be done away. As the Man is, ſo is his Talk. If he is one of this World, whoſe Name ſhall be written in the Earth. I pray God deliver me from that Doom, then according to our Saviour's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm, He ſpeaks of the World, <hi>They are of the World, therefore ſpeak they of the World.</hi> But if he doth indeed belong unto Heaven, then his Converſation is in Heaven, his Delight and his Heart is there, even before his Soul is admitted or doth enter therein. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154355:85"/> if ſo, and their Affections are once ſet on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and they know the difference, they neither do, nor yet can ſhew forth the like rejoicing (as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World do) at the common Accidents and little things here below. Neither are the Children of Light therefore bereaved of all Joy and Delight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for it is not taken away, but only changed and placed upon another Object as to them. For they take more ſatisfaction and Pleaſure in ſpeaking to one another of God, and of their fear towards him, and of the things pertaining to his Kingdom, than others do in fooliſh Talking, and Jeſting which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 4. nor yet ſo throughly ſatisfactory to the Heart of Man as that is. <hi>Let no corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, that it may Miniſter Grace unto the Hearers.</hi> Alas! How little is this obſerved in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Communication and Converſation in the World? And though we know how to approve the things that are excellent, and how to behave our ſelves in the ſolemn Meetings for the Worſhip of the Lord God, even with great Awe and Dread, thinking and ſaying with <hi>Jacob:</hi> How dreadful is this Place? this is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Gate of Heaven. Worſhip is a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſerious thing; for by this, if it be Right and Acceptable in the ſight of God, it is the Gate by which People are to enter into Heaven. Yet alas? People are not ſo awful and devout, and in good earneſt as they ought to be at their Worſhip, and they are yet ten times worſe, even ungodly, diſobedient, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide when they are from it.

Though no Man hath ſeen God at any time nor heard his Voice; yet at this very day he hath three ways of ſpeaking unto Mankind; By his written Word, by his Spirit in the Heart and Conſcience of each Man of Woman, and by his Miniſters. And we ſhould ſit down before God and be preſent before God for to receive and hear from him all theſe ways.</p>
            <p>It is related of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that about the time of his Converſion from a looſe debauched and wicked Life to the Chriſtian Life, he heard a Voice ſpeaking unto him, <hi>Take up the Book and read.</hi> Which he did accordingly, and dipping by chance as he thought, but by the ſpeical direction of God, upon the four laſt verſes of the 13.

               </gap>and us. And where is ſuch a Mind as is Willing and Obedient, Pure and Holy, Sanctified and Cleanſed, there he doth put his good Spirit or Angel which ſhall guide us all along, <hi>to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared, beware of him and obey his Voice, provoke him not, for he will not pardon your Tranſgreſſions</hi> (whence note that ſins againſt Conſcience are very dangerous) <hi>for my Name is in him,</hi> Exod. 23. 20, 21. <hi>What Man is he that feareth the Lord, him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe,</hi> Pſal. 25. 12.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:154355:86"/>
            <p>And then God doth ſpeak unto Mankind and teach them by his Word and by his Miniſters, who bring or at leaſt they ought to bring all their Exhortation unto the People from the former.

            <p>But to ſuch Miniſters who have the Knowledge and Life of God in them, his Method and Promiſe is, <hi>The Lord God hath given me the Tongue of the Learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in Seaſon to him that is weary; he wakeneth morning by morning,</hi> Iſa. 50. 4. So he putteth a ſeaſonable and ſuitable word into them for to ſpeak out unto his People Sabbath after Sabbath, and from one Lords day unto another; which as it is the Duty of one to utter and declare, ſo it is of the other for to come to hear and receive it. Hence it is alſo, though we Miniſters know not other Peoples thoughts or ſecret doings, or their hidden things of Diſhoneſty, or the things which are done of them in ſecret; yet we handle that word which is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart. And as God ſpeaks concerning the ſecret, deep and hidden ſinful doings of ſome, <hi>Though they be hid from my ſight in the bottom of the Sea, thence will I command the Serpent and he ſhall bite them,</hi> Amos 9. 3.
